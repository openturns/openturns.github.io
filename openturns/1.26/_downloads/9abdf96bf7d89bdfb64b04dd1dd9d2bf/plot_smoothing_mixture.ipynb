        "## Introduction\n\nWhen we have a sample, we may estimate the probability density function of the\nunderlying distribution using kernel smoothing.\nOne of the parameters of this method is the bandwidth, which can be either\nset by the user, or estimated from the data.\nThis is especially true when the density is multimodal.\nIn this example, we consider a bimodal distribution and see how the bandwidth\ncan change the estimated probability density function.\n\nWe consider the distribution:\n\n\\begin{align}f_1(x) = w_1 f_A(x) + w_2 f_B(x)\\end{align}\n\n\nfor any $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ where $f_A$ is the density of the Normal distribution\n$\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, $f_B$ is the density of the Normal distribution\n$\\mathcal{N}(3/2,(1/3)^2)$ and the weights are $w_1 = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $w_2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThis is a mixture of two Normal distributions: 1/4th of the observations have the $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$\ndistribution and 3/4th of the observations have the $\\mathcal{N}(3/2,(1/3)^2)$ distribution.\nThis example is considered in (Wand, Jones, 1994), page 14, Figure 2.3.\n\nWe consider a sample generated from independent realizations of $f_1$ and\nwant to approximate the distribution from kernel smoothing.\nMore precisely, we want to observe the sensitivity of the resulting density to the\nbandwidth.\n\n## References\n\n* \"Kernel Smoothing\", M.P.Wand, M.C.Jones.
