Hence we use the declustering method\nwhich filters the dependent observations exceeding a given threshold to obtain a\nset of threshold excesses that can be assumed as independent.\n\nFirst, we specify a threshold $u$.\nConsecutive exceedances of the threshold belong to the same cluster. Two distinct\nclusters are separated by $r$ consecutive observations under the\nthreshold. Within each cluster, we select the maximum value that will be used to\ninfer the GPD distribution. The cluster maxima are assumed to be independent.\n\nOn the graph, we show the clusters associated to the threshold $u=0$\nand the respective maximum selected from a\n100-day portion of the Wooster daily minimum temperature series.\nIt is possible to extract the data belonging to the same cluster and the\ncluster maximum series.\n\n"
