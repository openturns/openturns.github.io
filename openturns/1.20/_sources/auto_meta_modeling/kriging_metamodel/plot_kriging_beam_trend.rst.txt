Choose the trend basis of a kriging metamodel
=============================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-13

The goal of this example is to show how to configure the trend in a Kriging metamodel. This is why this example focuses on the three available trends:

* `ConstantBasisFactory`,
* `LinearBasisFactory`,
* `QuadraticBasisFactory`.

For this purpose, we use the :ref:`cantilever beam <use-case-cantilever-beam>` example.

Definition of the model
-----------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-26

.. code-block:: default

    from openturns.usecases import cantilever_beam
    import openturns as ot
    from openturns.viewer import View

    ot.RandomGenerator.SetSeed(0)
    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 27-28

We load the use case :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-30

.. code-block:: default

    cb = cantilever_beam.CantileverBeam()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-32

We define the function which evaluates the output depending on the inputs.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-34

.. code-block:: default

    model = cb.model








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-36

Then we define the distribution of the input random vector.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-39

.. code-block:: default

    dimension = cb.dim  # number of inputs
    myDistribution = cb.distribution








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-42

Create the design of experiments
--------------------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-45

We consider a simple Monte-Carlo sampling as a design of experiments. This is why we generate an input sample using the `getSample` method of the distribution. Then we evaluate the output using the `model` function.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-51

.. code-block:: default

    sampleSize_train = 10
    X_train = myDistribution.getSample(sampleSize_train)
    Y_train = model(X_train)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-54

Create the metamodel
--------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-58

In order to create the Kriging metamodel, we first select a constant trend with the `ConstantBasisFactory` class. Then we use a squared exponential covariance kernel.
The `SquaredExponential` kernel has one amplitude coefficient and 4 scale coefficients. This is because this covariance kernel is anisotropic : each of the 4 input variables is associated with its own scale coefficient.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-63

.. code-block:: default

    basis = ot.ConstantBasisFactory(dimension).build()
    covarianceModel = ot.SquaredExponential(dimension)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-66

Typically, the optimization algorithm is quite good at setting sensible optimization bounds.
In this case, however, the range of the input domain is extreme.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-71

.. code-block:: default

    print("Lower and upper bounds of X_train:")
    print(X_train.getMin(), X_train.getMax())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Lower and upper bounds of X_train:
    [6.50185e+10,262.654,2.50948,1.40294e-07] [6.88439e+10,323.088,2.59143,1.5807e-07]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-74

We need to manually define sensible optimization bounds.
Note that since the amplitude parameter is computed analytically (this is possible when the output dimension is 1), we only need to set bounds on the scale parameter.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 76-80

.. code-block:: default

    scaleOptimizationBounds = ot.Interval(
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0e-10], [1.0e11, 1.0e3, 1.0e1, 1.0e-5]
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-85

Finally, we use the `KrigingAlgorithm` class to create the Kriging metamodel.
It requires a training sample, a covariance kernel and a trend basis as input arguments.
We need to set the initial scale parameter for the optimization. The upper bound of the input domain is a sensible choice here.
We must not forget to actually set the optimization bounds defined above.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-91

.. code-block:: default

    covarianceModel.setScale(X_train.getMax())
    algo = ot.KrigingAlgorithm(X_train, Y_train, covarianceModel, basis)

The `getTrendCoefficients` method returns the coefficients of the trend.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 126-139

The number of coefficients in the linear and quadratic trends depends on the number of inputs, which is
equal to

.. math::
   dim = 4


in the cantilever beam case.

We observe that the number of coefficients in the trend is 5, which corresponds to:

* 1 coefficient for the constant part,
* dim=4 coefficients for the linear part.

This time, the trend has 15 coefficients:

* 1 coefficient for the constant part,
* 4 coefficients for the linear part,
* 10 coefficients for the quadratic part.

This is because the number of coefficients in the quadratic part has

.. math::
   \frac{dim (dim+1)}{2}=\frac{4\times 5}{2}=10


coefficients, associated with the symmetric matrix of the quadratic function.

Validate the metamodel
----------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 172-173

We finally want to validate the Kriging metamodel. This is why we generate a validation sample with size 100 and we evaluate the output of the model on this sample.

We observe that the three trends perform very well in this case. With more coefficients, the Kriging metamodel is more flexibile and can adjust better to the training sample. This does not mean, however, that the trend coefficients will provide a good fit for the validation sample.

The number of parameters in each Kriging metamodel is the following:

* the constant trend Kriging has 6 coefficients to estimate: 5 coefficients for the covariance matrix and 1 coefficient for the trend,
* the linear trend Kriging has 10 coefficients to estimate: 5 coefficients for the covariance matrix and 5 coefficients for the trend,
* the quadratic trend Kriging has 20 coefficients to estimate: 5 coefficients for the covariance matrix and 15 coefficients for the trend.

In the cantilever beam example, fitting the metamodel to a training sample with only 10 points is made much easier because the function to approximate is almost linear.
In this case, a quadratic trend is not advisable because it can interpolate all points in the training sample.
