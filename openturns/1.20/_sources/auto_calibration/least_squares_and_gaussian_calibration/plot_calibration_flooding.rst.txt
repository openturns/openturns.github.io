Calibration of the flooding model
=================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-70

In this example we are interested in the calibration of the :ref:`flooding model <use-case-flood-model>`.
In this example we calibrate the parameters of a flooding model where only the difference between the downstream and upstream riverbed levels can be calibrated. This example shows how to manage the lack of identifiability in a calibration problem.

Parameters to calibrate
-----------------------

The vector of parameters to calibrate is:

.. math::
   \theta = (K_s,Z_v,Z_m).


The variables to calibrate are :math:`(K_s,Z_v,Z_m)` and are set to the following values:

.. math::
   K_s = 30, \qquad Z_v = 50, \qquad Z_m = 55.


Observations
------------

In this section, we describe the statistical model associated with the :math:`n` observations.
The errors of the water heights are associated with a normal distribution with a zero mean and a standard variation equal to:

.. math::
   \sigma=0.1.


Therefore, the observed water heights are:

.. math::
   H_i = G(Q_i,K_s,Z_v,Z_m) + \epsilon_i


for :math:`i=1,...,n` where

.. math::
   \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)


and we make the hypothesis that the observation errors are independent.
We consider a sample size equal to:

.. math::
   n=100.


The observations are the couples :math:`\{(Q_i,H_i)\}_{i=1,...,n}`, i.e. each observation is a couple made of the flowrate and the corresponding river height.

Variables
---------

- Q : Input. Observed.
- Ks, Zv, Zm : Input. Calibrated.
- H: Output. Observed.

Analysis
--------

In the description of the :ref:`flooding model<use-case-flood-model>`, we see that only one parameter
can be identified.
Hence, calibrating this model requires some regularization.
We return to this topic when analyzing the singular values of
the Jacobian matrix.

We define the model :math:`g` which has 4 inputs and one output H.

The nonlinear least squares does not take into account for bounds in the parameters. Therefore, we ensure that the output is computed whatever the inputs. The model fails into two situations:

* if :math:`K_s<0`,
* if :math:`Z_v-Z_m<0`.

In these cases, we return an infinite number, so that the optimization algorithm does not get trapped.

We can see that there are two singular values which are relatively close to zero.

This explains why the Jacobian matrix is close to being rank-degenerate.

Moreover, this allows one to compute the actual dimensionality of the problem.
The algorithm we use computes the singular values in descending order.
Moreover, by definition, the singular values are nonnegative.
We see that the first singular value is close to :math:`10`
and the others are very close to :math:`0` in comparison.
This implies that the (numerical) rank of the Jacobian matrix is 1,
even if there are 3 parameters.

Hence, only one parameter can be identified, be it :math:`K_s`, :math:`Z_v` or :math:`Z_m`.
The choice of the particular parameter to identify is free.
However, in hydraulic studies, the parameter :math:`K_s` is classically
calibrated while :math:`Z_v` and :math:`Z_m` are left constant.

Conclusion of the linear least squares calibration
--------------------------------------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 293-297

There are several methods to solve the problem.

* Given that the problem is not identifiable, we can use some regularization method. Two methods are provided in the library: the Gaussian linear least squares `GaussianLinearCalibration` and the Gaussian non linear least squares `GaussianNonlinearCalibration`.
* We can change the problem, replacing it with a problem which is identifiable. In the flooding model, we can view :math:`Z_v` and :math:`Z_m` as constants and calibrate :math:`K_s` only.

We can compute a 95% confidence interval of the parameter :math:`\theta^\star`.

This confidence interval is based on bootstrap, based on a sample size equal to 100 (as long as the value of the `ResourceMap` key "NonLinearLeastSquaresCalibration-BootstrapSize" is unchanged). This confidence interval reflects the sensitivity of the optimum to the variability in the observations.

The two distributions are different, which shows that the calibration is sensible to the observations (if the observations were not sensible, the two distributions were superimposed).
Moreover, the two distributions are quite close, which implies that the prior distribution has played a roled in the calibration (otherwise the two distributions would be completely different,
indicating that only the observations were taken into account).

The two distributions are very different, with a spiky posterior distribution. This shows that the calibration is very sensible to the observations.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 575-584

Tuning the posterior distribution estimation
--------------------------------------------

The "GaussianNonLinearCalibration-BootstrapSize" key controls the posterior distribution estimation.

* If "GaussianNonLinearCalibration-BootstrapSize" > 0 (by default it is equal to 100), then a bootstrap resample algorithm is used to see the dispersion of the MAP estimator. This allows one to see the variability of the estimator with respect to the finite observation sample.
* If "GaussianNonLinearCalibration-BootstrapSize" is zero, then the Gaussian linear calibration estimator is used (i.e. the `GaussianLinearCalibration` class) at the optimum. This is called the Laplace approximation.

We must configure the key before creating the object (otherwise changing the parameter does not change the result).
