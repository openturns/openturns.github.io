Draw fields
===========

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-17

The objective here is to manipulate a multivariate stochastic process :math:`X: \Omega \times \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d`, where :math:`\mathcal{D} \in \mathbb{R}^n` is discretized on the mesh :math:`\mathcal{M}` and exhibit some of the services exposed by the *Process* objects:

- ask for the dimension, with the method getOutputDimension
- ask for the mesh, with the method getMesh
- ask for the mesh as regular 1-d mesh, with the getTimeGrid method
- ask for a realization, with the method the getRealization method
- ask for a continuous realization, with the getContinuousRealization method
- ask for a sample of realizations, with the getSample method
- ask for the normality of the process with the isNormal method
- ask for the stationarity of the process with the isStationary method

    from matplotlib import pylab as plt

    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-27

We create a mesh -a time grid- which is a RegularGrid :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 27-33

.. code-block:: default

    tMin = 0.0
    timeStep = 0.1
    n = 100
    time_grid = ot.RegularGrid(tMin, timeStep, n)
    time_grid.setName("time")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-36

We create a Normal process :math:`X_t = (X_t^0, X_t^1, X_t^2)` in dimension 3 with an exponential covariance model.
We define the amplitude and the scale of the `ExponentialModel`

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-39

.. code-block:: default

    scale = [4.0]
    amplitude = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-41

We define a spatial correlation :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 41-46

.. code-block:: default

    spatialCorrelation = ot.CorrelationMatrix(3)
    spatialCorrelation[0, 1] = 0.8
    spatialCorrelation[0, 2] = 0.6
    spatialCorrelation[1, 2] = 0.1








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-48

The covariance model is now created with :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-50

.. code-block:: default

    myCovarianceModel = ot.ExponentialModel(scale, amplitude, spatialCorrelation)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-52

Eventually, the process is  built with :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-54

.. code-block:: default

    process = ot.GaussianProcess(myCovarianceModel, time_grid)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 55-56

The dimension d of the process may be retrieved by

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-59

.. code-block:: default

    dim = process.getOutputDimension()
    print("Dimension : %d" % dim)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Dimension : 3




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-61

The underlying mesh of the process is obtained with the `getMesh` method :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-63

.. code-block:: default

    mesh = process.getMesh()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-65

We have access to peculiar data of the mesh such as the corners :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-68

.. code-block:: default

    minMesh = mesh.getVertices().getMin()[0]
    maxMesh = mesh.getVertices().getMax()[0]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-70

We draw it :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-77

.. code-block:: default

    graph = mesh.draw()
    graph.setTitle("Time grid (mesh)")
    graph.setXTitle("t")
    graph.setYTitle("")
    view = viewer.View(graph)

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-79

We can get the time grid of the process when the mesh can be interpreted as a regular time grid :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-82

.. code-block:: default

    print(process.getTimeGrid())






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    RegularGrid(start=0, step=0.1, n=100)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 83-84

A typical feature of a process is the generation of a realization of itself :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 84-86

.. code-block:: default

    realization = process.getRealization()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-88

Here it is a sample of size :math:`100 \times 4` (100 time steps, 3 spatial cooordinates and the time variable). We are able to draw its marginals, for instance the first (index 0) one :math:`X_t^0`, against the time with no interpolation :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 88-95

.. code-block:: default

    interpolate = False
    graph = realization.drawMarginal(0, interpolate)
    graph.setTitle("First marginal of a realization of the process")
    graph.setXTitle("t")
    graph.setYTitle(r"$X_t^0$")
    view = viewer.View(graph)

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 96-97

The same graph, but with interpolated values (default behaviour) :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 97-104

.. code-block:: default

    graph = realization.drawMarginal(0)
    graph.setTitle("First marginal of a realization of the process")
    graph.setXTitle("t")
    graph.setYTitle(r"$X_t^0$")
    view = viewer.View(graph)

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 105-106

We can build a function representing the process using P1-Lagrange interpolation (when not defined from a functional model).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 106-108

.. code-block:: default

    continuousRealization = process.getContinuousRealization()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 109-110

Once again we draw its first marginal :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-116

.. code-block:: default

    marginal0 = continuousRealization.getMarginal(0)
    graph = marginal0.draw(minMesh, maxMesh)
    graph.setTitle("First marginal of a P1-Lagrange continuous realization of the process")
    graph.setXTitle("t")
    view = viewer.View(graph)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 117-119

Please note that the `marginal0` object is a function. Consequently we can
evaluate it at any point of the domain, say :math:`t_0=3.5678`

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 119-123

.. code-block:: default

    t0 = 3.5678
    print(t0, marginal0([t0]))






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    3.5678 [-0.593188]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 124-125

Several realizations of the process may be determined at once :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 125-128

.. code-block:: default

    number = 10
    fieldSample = process.getSample(number)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 129-130

Let us draw them the first marginal)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 130-136

.. code-block:: default

    graph = fieldSample.drawMarginal(0, False)
    graph.setTitle("First marginal of 10 realizations of the process")
    graph.setXTitle("t")
    graph.setYTitle(r"$X_t^0$")
    view = viewer.View(graph)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 137-138

Same graph, but with interpolated values :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 138-145

.. code-block:: default

    graph = fieldSample.drawMarginal(0)
    graph.setTitle("First marginal of 10 realizations of the process")
    graph.setXTitle("t")
    graph.setYTitle(r"$X_t^0$")
    view = viewer.View(graph)

Miscellanies
------------

We can extract any marginal of the process with the `getMarginal` method.
Beware the numerotation begins at 0 ! It may be not implemented yet for
some processes.
The extracted marginal is a 1D gaussian process :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 153-155

.. code-block:: default

    print(process.getMarginal([1]))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    GaussianProcess(trend=[x0]->[0.0], covariance=ExponentialModel(scale=[4], amplitude=[2], no spatial correlation))




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 156-157

If we extract simultaneously two indices we build a 2D gaussian process :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 157-159

.. code-block:: default

    print(process.getMarginal([0, 2]))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    GaussianProcess(trend=[x0]->[0.0,0.0], covariance=ExponentialModel(scale=[4], amplitude=[1,3], spatial correlation=
    [[ 1   0.6 ]
     [ 0.6 1   ]]))




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 160-161

We can check whether the process is normal or not :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 161-163

.. code-block:: default

    print("Is normal ? ", process.isNormal())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Is normal ?  True




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 164-165

and the stationarity as well :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 165-168

.. code-block:: default

    print("Is stationary ? ", process.isStationary())

    plt.show()




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Is stationary ?  True
