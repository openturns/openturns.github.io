Save/load a study
=================
The objective of this example is to demonstrate how to save the structures created within a script session to disk in order to be able to load them in a future session.

There are several possible ways to achieve this:

- with the standard pickle module
- with openturns's Study

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-19

.. code-block:: default

    import openturns as ot
    import pickle

    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 20-21

create objects to save

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-24

.. code-block:: default

    distribution = ot.Normal(4.0, 3.0)
    function = ot.SymbolicFunction(["x1", "x2"], ["x1 + x2"])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-28

**With the pickle module**

The objects are retrieved in the same order they are stored.

save objects

.. code-block:: default

    with open("study.pkl", "wb") as f:
        pickle.dump(distribution, f)
        pickle.dump(function, f)

load saved objects

.. code-block:: default

    with open("study.pkl", "rb") as f:
        loaded_distribution = pickle.load(f)
        loaded_function = pickle.load(f)
    str(loaded_distribution), str(loaded_function)

**With OpenTURNS' Study**

In order to be able to manipulate the objects contained in a Study, it is necessary to:

- create the same empty structure in the new study,
- fill this new empty structure with the content of the loaded structure, identified with its name or its id.

Each object is identified whether with:

- its name: it is useful to give names to the objects we want to save. If no name has been given by the user, we can use the default name. The name of each saved object can be checked in the output XML file or with the python `print` command (applied to the `Study` object).
- its id number: this id number is unique to each object. It distinguishes objects with identical type and name (like the default name "Unnamed"). This id number may be checked by printing the study **after** it has been loaded in the python interface (with the `print` command). It can differ from the id number indicated in the XML file the study was loaded from.
- for HDF5 storage (see below): the id serves both as xml id and hdf5 dataset name. Id uniqueness forbids any misleading in reading/writing hdf5 datasets.

Create a Study Object

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-60

.. code-block:: default

    study = ot.Study()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-62

Associate it to an XML file

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 62-65

.. code-block:: default

    fileName = "study.xml"
    study.setStorageManager(ot.XMLStorageManager(fileName))








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-67

Alternatively, large amounts of data can be stored in binary HDF5 file. An XML file (`study_h5.xml`) serves as header for binary data, which are stored in the automatically created `study_h5.h5` file.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-71

.. code-block:: default

    study_h5 = ot.Study()
    fileName_h5 = "study_h5.xml"

Add an object to the study; at this point it is not written to disk yet

Save the study; this writes into the file
