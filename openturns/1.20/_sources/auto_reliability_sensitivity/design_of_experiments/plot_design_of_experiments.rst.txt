The goal of this example is to present several design of experiments available in OpenTURNS.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-69

In order to see the LHS property, we need to set the bounds.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-79

We see that each column or row exactly contains one single point. This shows that a LHS design of experimens has good 1D projection properties, and, hence, is a good candidate for a space filling design.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-83

Optimized LHS
-------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-88

    distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([ot.Uniform()] * 3)

We see that this LHS is optimized in the sense that it fills the space more evenly than a non-optimized does in general.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 133-134

We have elementary intervals in 2 dimensions, each having a volume equal to 1/8. Since there are 32 points, the Sobol' sequence is so that each elementary interval contains exactly 32/8 = 4 points. Notice that each elementary interval is closed on the left (or bottom) and open on the right (or top).

We have elementary intervals in 2 dimensions, each having a volume equal to 1/12. Since there are 36 points, the Halton sequence is so that each elementary interval contains exactly 36/12 = 3 points. Notice that each elementary interval is closed on the left (or bottom) and open on the right (or top).
