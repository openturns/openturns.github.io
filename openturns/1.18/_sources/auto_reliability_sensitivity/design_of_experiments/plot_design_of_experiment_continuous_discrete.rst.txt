Create a design of experiments with discrete and continuous variables
=====================================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-7

In this example we present how to create a design of experiments when one (or several) of the marginals are discrete.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 9-15

.. code-block:: default

    from __future__ import print_function
    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as viewer
    from matplotlib import pylab as plt
    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-17

To create the first marginal of the distribution, we select a univariate discrete distribution. Some of them, like the `Bernoulli` or `Geometric` distributions, are implemented in the library as classes. In this example however, we pick the `UserDefined` distribution that assigns equal weights to the values -2, -1, 1 and 2.

For the second marginal, we pick a Gaussian distribution.

.. code-block:: default

    X1 = ot.Normal()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-33

Create the multivariate distribution from its marginals and an independent copula.

.. code-block:: default

    distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([X0, X1])

Create the design.

.. code-block:: default

    size = 100
    experiment = ot.MonteCarloExperiment(distribution, size)
    sample = experiment.generate()

Plot the design.

.. code-block:: default

    graph = ot.Graph("MonteCarloExperiment", "x0", "x1", True, "")
    cloud = ot.Cloud(sample, "blue", "fsquare", "")
    graph.add(cloud)
    view = viewer.View(graph)

Any other type of design of experiments can be generated based on this distribution. The following example shows a LHS experiment.

.. code-block:: default

    size = 100
    alwaysShuffle = True
    randomShift = True
    experiment = ot.LHSExperiment(distribution, size, alwaysShuffle, randomShift)
    sample = experiment.generate()
