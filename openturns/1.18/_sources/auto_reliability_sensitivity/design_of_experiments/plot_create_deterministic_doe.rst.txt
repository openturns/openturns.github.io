Create a deterministic design of experiments
============================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-13

Four types of deterministic designs of experiments are available:

- :class:`~openturns.Axial`
- :class:`~openturns.Factorial`
- :class:`~openturns.Composite`
- :class:`~openturns.Box`

Each type of deterministic design is discretized differently according to a number of levels.

Functionally speaking, a design is a :class:`~openturns.Sample` that lies within the unit cube :math:`(0,1)^d` and can be scaled and moved to cover the desired box.

We will use the following function to plot bi-dimensional samples.

    def drawBidimensionalSample(sample, title):
        n = sample.getSize()
        graph = ot.Graph("%s, size=%d" % (title, n), r"$X_1$", r"$X_2$", True, '')
        #cloud = ot.Cloud(sample)
        cloud = ot.Cloud(sample, "blue", "fsquare", "")
        graph.add(cloud)
        return graph

Axial design
------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-50

.. code-block:: default

    levels = [1.0, 1.5, 3.0]
    experiment = ot.Axial(2, levels)
    sample = experiment.generate()
    graph = drawBidimensionalSample(sample, "Axial")
    view = viewer.View(graph)

Use \*= to rescale and += to move a design.
Pay attention to the grid in the next graph.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-79

Composite design
----------------

A composite design is a stratified design of experiments enabling to create a pattern as the union of an Axial pattern and a Factorial one. The number of points generated is :math:`1 + n_{\mathrm{level}}(2n+2^n)`.
