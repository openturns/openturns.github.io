Sort a sample
=============

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-7

In this example we present useful methods of the `Sample` object such as marginals extraction and various sorting strategies.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-15

.. code-block:: default

    import openturns as ot
    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)
    ot.RandomGenerator.SetSeed(0)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-17

We start by defining the distribution of a regular non-biased die.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 17-19

.. code-block:: default

    die_distribution = ot.UserDefined([[i] for i in range(1, 7)])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 20-21

We consider now an experiment with two independent dice and build the corresponding random vector :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-23

.. code-block:: default

    two_dice_distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([die_distribution]*2)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-25

We now build a sample of size :math:`n=5` from this distribution :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-29

.. code-block:: default

    n = 5
    sample = two_dice_distribution.getSample(n)
    print(sample)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

        [ X0 X1 ]
    0 : [ 1  3  ]
    1 : [ 3  2  ]
    2 : [ 4  3  ]
    3 : [ 4  4  ]
    4 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 30-32

Useful methods
--------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-35

We have access to the marginals by providing a list of the wanted indices :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-42

.. code-block:: default


    # the first marginal
    sample_die1 = sample.getMarginal([0])

    # the second marginal
    sample_die2 = sample.getMarginal([1])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-45

Suppose we are interested in the sum of the two dice. This can be done by summing the two samples `die1` and `die2`.
Provided the dimensions are the same we can add samples with the `+` operator and produce a new sample :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-47

.. code-block:: default

    experiment = sample_die1 + sample_die2








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-49

Note that the `+=` operator is defined as well.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-52

We can concatenate two samples having the same size with the `stack` method :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-55

.. code-block:: default

    sample_die1.stack(sample_die2)
    print(sample_die1)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

        [ X0 X1 ]
    0 : [ 1  3  ]
    1 : [ 3  2  ]
    2 : [ 4  3  ]
    3 : [ 4  4  ]
    4 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-57

We can split a sample in two by giving an index (here 2).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-62

.. code-block:: default

    remaining = sample_die1.split(2)
    print(sample_die1)
    print(remaining)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

        [ X0 X1 ]
    0 : [ 1  3  ]
    1 : [ 3  2  ]
        [ X0 X1 ]
    0 : [ 4  3  ]
    1 : [ 4  4  ]
    2 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-65

Sorting samples
---------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-69

We can extract any marginal and sort it by ascending order by specifying the index :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-72

.. code-block:: default

    sorted_marginal = sample.sort(1)
    print(sorted_marginal)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    0 : [ 2 ]
    1 : [ 3 ]
    2 : [ 3 ]
    3 : [ 4 ]
    4 : [ 5 ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-74

We can sort the sample in place, that is whithout creating a new sample, as well with sortInPlace. When the dimension is greater than one the sort is made according to the first marginal.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-77

.. code-block:: default

    sample.sortInPlace()
    print(sample)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

        [ X0 X1 ]
    0 : [ 1  3  ]
    1 : [ 3  2  ]
    2 : [ 4  3  ]
    3 : [ 4  4  ]
    4 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-79

We can sort the rows according to the second marginal with the `sortAccordingToAComponent` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-82

.. code-block:: default

    another_sample = sample.sortAccordingToAComponent(1)
    print(another_sample)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

        [ X0 X1 ]
    0 : [ 3  2  ]
    1 : [ 1  3  ]
    2 : [ 4  3  ]
    3 : [ 4  4  ]
    4 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 83-84

There is also a `sortAccordingToAComponentInPlace` method that does the same without creating a new sample.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-87

We can sort and remove the duplicates at the same time

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-90

.. code-block:: default

    print(sample_die2)
    print(sample_die2.sortUnique())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

        [ X1 ]
    0 : [ 3  ]
    1 : [ 2  ]
    2 : [ 3  ]
    3 : [ 4  ]
    4 : [ 5  ]
        [ X1 ]
    0 : [ 2  ]
    1 : [ 3  ]
    2 : [ 4  ]
    3 : [ 5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-92

We note that the sample is smaller as expected. Sorting in place is also possible :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 92-95

.. code-block:: default

    sample_die2.sortUniqueInPlace()
    print(sample_die2)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

        [ X1 ]
    0 : [ 2  ]
    1 : [ 3  ]
    2 : [ 4  ]
    3 : [ 5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 96-97

Let's try with the sample in dimension 2 :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 97-100

.. code-block:: default

    sampleUnique = sample.sortUnique()
    print(sampleUnique)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

        [ X0 X1 ]
    0 : [ 1  3  ]
    1 : [ 3  2  ]
    2 : [ 4  3  ]
    3 : [ 4  4  ]
    4 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 101-102

Nothing happens here because pairs are already unique !
