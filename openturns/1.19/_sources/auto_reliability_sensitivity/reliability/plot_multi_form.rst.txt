Use the FORM algorithm in case of several design points
=======================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-11

Abstract
--------

In this example we showcase the :class:`~openturns.MultiFORM` class which can perform a FORM analysis with several
design points.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-19

    import openturns as ot

We consider a standard bivariate Gaussian random vector :math:`X = (X_1, X_2)` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-24

.. code-block:: default

    dim = 2
    dist = ot.Normal(dim)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-26

We can draw the bidimensional PDF of the distribution `dist` over :math:`[-5,5] \times [-5,5]` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-34

.. code-block:: default

    ot.ResourceMap.SetAsUnsignedInteger("Contour-DefaultLevelsNumber", 8)
    graphPDF = dist.drawPDF([-5, -5], [5, 5])
    graphPDF.setTitle(r'2D-PDF of the input variables $(X_1, X_2)$')
    graphPDF.setXTitle(r'$x_1$')
    graphPDF.setYTitle(r'$x_2$')
    graphPDF.setLegendPosition("bottomright")
    view = otv.View(graphPDF)

We then define a model :math:`f` which maps a 2D-vector X = (X_1,X_2) to a
scalar output `Y = f(X)`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 37-45

.. code-block:: default

    f = ot.SymbolicFunction(['x0', 'x1'], ['5.0-x1-0.5*(x0-0.1)^2'])
    graphModel = f.draw([-8.0, -8.0], [8.0, 8.0])
    graphModel.setXTitle(r'$x_1$')
    graphModel.setXTitle(r'$x_2$')
    graphModel.setTitle(r'Isolines of the model : $Y = f(X)$')
    view = otv.View(graphModel)

We create random vectors for the input and output variables :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-51

.. code-block:: default

    X = ot.RandomVector(dist)
    Y = ot.CompositeRandomVector(f, X)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-53

The failure domain :math:`\mathcal{D}` is :math:`\mathcal{D} = \{ x=(x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 / f(x) \geq 0 \}`

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-56

.. code-block:: default

    failureEvent = ot.ThresholdEvent(Y, ot.Less(), 0.0)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-58

We shall represent the failure domain event using a :class:`~openturns.Contour` object.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-69

.. code-block:: default

    nx, ny = 25, 25
    xx = ot.Box([nx], ot.Interval([-8.0], [8.0])).generate()
    yy = ot.Box([ny], ot.Interval([-8.0], [8.0])).generate()
    inputData = ot.Box([nx, ny], ot.Interval([-8.0, -8.0], [8.0, 8.0])).generate()
    outputData = f(inputData)

In the physical space the failure domain boundary is the dashed black curve. We recall that one of
the steps of the FORM method is to find the closest point of the failure domain boundary to the origin.
Here we see that the symmetry of the domain implies that two points exist, one in the :math:`x_1 \geq 0` half-space and the other in the :math:`x_1 \leq 0` half-space.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 76-78

We build the :class:`~openturns.MultiFORM` algorithm in a similar fashion as the :class:`~openturns.FORM` algorithm. We choose an optimization solver, here the Cobyla solver, and a starting point, the mean
of the distribution `dist`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-83

.. code-block:: default

    solver = ot.Cobyla()
    starting_pt = dist.getMean()
    algo = ot.MultiFORM(solver, failureEvent, starting_pt)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 84-85

We are ready to run the algorithm and store the result in the :class:`~openturns.MultiFORM` class :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-88

.. code-block:: default

    algo.run()
    result = algo.getResult()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 89-90

We have access to the results with the getFORMResultCollection method which produces a collection of :class:`~openturns.FORMResult` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-92

.. code-block:: default

    coll = result.getFORMResultCollection()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 93-94

The length of this collection is the number of design points :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 94-98

.. code-block:: default

    n_design_pts = len(coll)
    print("Number of design points :", n_design_pts)

    Number of design points : 2




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-101

We have access to the design points with the getPhysicalSpaceDesignPoint method for each element of
the collection `coll`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 101-106

.. code-block:: default

    designPointPhysicalSpace1 = coll[0].getPhysicalSpaceDesignPoint()
    designPointPhysicalSpace2 = coll[1].getPhysicalSpaceDesignPoint()

We recall that the FORM approximate is based on the substitution of the failure domain by the half-space defined by the tangent at the design point. Here we can clearly see that this would miss half of the information. That is why both design points are needed.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 128-129

For each design point we have a probability associated to the approximation by the half-space :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 129-132

.. code-block:: default

    pf1 = coll[0].getEventProbability()
    pf2 = coll[1].getEventProbability()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 133-134

The probability of failure is the given by the :meth:`~openturns.MultiFORMResult.getEventProbability` which is the sum of the two previous probabilities `pf1` and `pf2` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 134-139

.. code-block:: default

    pf = result.getEventProbability()
    print("Probability of failure : ", pf)
    print("    wrt design point 1 : ", pf1)
    print("    wrt design point 2 : ", pf2)
