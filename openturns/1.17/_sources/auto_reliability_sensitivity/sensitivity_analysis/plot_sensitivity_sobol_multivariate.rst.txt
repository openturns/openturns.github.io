Estimate Sobol' indices for a function with multivariate output
===============================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-9

In this example, we estimate the Sobol' indices of a function by sampling methods. 
This function has several outputs, which leads to the need of aggregated Sobol' indices. 


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-18

Introduction
------------

In this example we quantify the sensitivity of a function's outputs to its inputs with Sobol' indices.

The function we consider has 5 outputs. In this case, it may be convenient to consider each output separately. It may also be interesting to aggregate the sensitivity indices to get a global understanding of the sensitivity of the inputs to the average output.

Define the model
----------------

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer

We define a linear model with 5 independent Gaussian inputs and 2 ouputs.

    inputDistribution = ot.Normal(5)
    function = ot.SymbolicFunction(['x0', 'x1', 'x2', 'x3', 'x4'], 
                                   ['x0 + 4.0 * x1 ^ 2 + 3.0 * x2', 
                                    '-7.0 * x2 - 4.0 * x3 + x4'])

Estimate the Sobol' indices
---------------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-43

We first create a design of experiments with `SobolIndicesExperiment`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-52

.. code-block:: default

    size = 1000
    sie = ot.SobolIndicesExperiment(inputDistribution, size)
    inputDesign = sie.generate()
    input_names = inputDistribution.getDescription()
    inputDesign.setDescription(input_names)
    print("Sample size: ", inputDesign.getSize())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Sample size:  7000




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-55

We see that 7000 function evaluations are required to estimate the first order and total Sobol' indices.
Then we evaluate the outputs corresponding to this design of experiments.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-59

.. code-block:: default

    outputDesign = function(inputDesign)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-61

Then we estimate the Sobol' indices with the `SaltelliSensitivityAlgorithm`. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-65

.. code-block:: default

    sensitivityAnalysis = ot.SaltelliSensitivityAlgorithm(inputDesign, outputDesign, size)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-69

The `getFirstOrderIndices` and `getTotalOrderIndices` method respectively return estimates of first order and total Sobol' indices with a given output.
Since these depend on the output marginal, the index of the output must 
be specified (the default is to return the index for the first output).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 71-84

.. code-block:: default

    output_dimension = function.getOutputDimension()
    for i in range(output_dimension):
        print("Output #", i)
        first_order = sensitivityAnalysis.getFirstOrderIndices(i)
        total_order = sensitivityAnalysis.getTotalOrderIndices(i)
        print("    First order indices: ", first_order)
        print("    Total order indices: ", total_order)

    agg_first_order = sensitivityAnalysis.getAggregatedFirstOrderIndices()
    agg_total_order = sensitivityAnalysis.getAggregatedTotalOrderIndices()
    print("Agg. first order indices: ", agg_first_order)
    print("Agg. total order indices: ", agg_total_order)

We see that:

* `x1` has a rather large first order index on the first output, but a small index on the second output, 

* `x2` has a rather large first order index on the first output on both outputs,

* the largest aggregated Sobol' index is `x2`, 

* `x0` and `x5` have Sobol' indices which are close to zero regardless of whether the indices are aggregated or not.

The `draw` method produces the following graph. The vertical bars represent the 95% confidence intervals of the estimates. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-102

.. code-block:: default

    graph = sensitivityAnalysis.draw()
    view = viewer.View(graph)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 103-105

Since there are several outputs, the graph presents the aggregated Sobol' indices. 
The aggregated Sobol' indices indicate that the input variable which has the largest impact on the variability of the several outputs is `x2`.
