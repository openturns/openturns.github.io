Merge nodes in Smolyak quadrature
=================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-11

The goal of this example is to see the effect of the merge algorithm in
Smolyak's quadrature implemented in :class:`openturns.experimental.SmolyakExperiment`.
We analyse the sensitivity of the number of nodes to the relative
and absolute tolerances.
Then we analyse the effect of the merge algorithm on the number of nodes.

The following examples shows how to get the relative and absolute tolerances.
These tolerances are used in the algorithm in order to identify potentially
duplicated nodes, taking into account for rounding errors.

We are interested in the sensitivity of the number of nodes to the tolerances
of the merging algorithm.
The next function takes the level and tolerances as input arguments,
and returns the size of Smolyak's quadrature using Gauss-Legendre nodes.

In the following experiments, we use
:math:`\epsilon = \epsilon_a = \epsilon_r` i.e.
the relative and absolute tolerances are set to be equal.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 62-69

In general, we want the tolerance to be as small as possible.
This is because we want the merge algorithm to detect candidate nodes
which truly overlap.
Indeed, our goal is to make the algorithm be insensitive to rounding errors,
but we do not want to merge two nodes which are significantly different.
We first want to see what is the effect when the tolerance is set to
a too small value.

Hence, 283 nodes are produced with a tolerance set to zero,
or to a very small value.

If the tolerance is set to a larger value, then 2 nodes are detected

We see that changing the tolerance from :math:`10^{-6}` down
to :math:`10^{-20}` does not change much the size of Smolyak's
quadrature.
Using :math:`\epsilon = 10^{-1}` reduces the number of nodes by a too large
amount.
This is because a relatively large tolerance considers that many candidate
nodes are close to each other, so that these nodes are merged.
In this case, the quadrature is not accurate enough.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 130-133

In the next `for` loop, for each value of the `level` parameter,
we decrease the tolerance from :math:`10^{-1}`
down to :math:`10^{-5}` and see how this changes the number of nodes.

We see that changing the tolerance from :math:`1` down to :math:`10^{-3}`
changes the number of nodes.
Below this threshold, the number of nodes does not change much.

The `SmolyakExperiment-MergeQuadrature` key of the `ResourceMap` allows
to disable or enable the merge algorithm.
In order to see its effect, the following script performs a loop over
the levels and compute the size without and with the merge algorithm.
Then we plot the number of nodes which have been detected as duplicated
and plot it versus the level.

We see that the number of nodes is reduced when the merge algorithm is
enabled.
Moreover, the number of nodes which are duplicated increases when the
level increases.
