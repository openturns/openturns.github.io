Create mixed deterministic and probabilistic designs of experiments
===================================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-15

In this example we build a mixed deterministic and probabilistic design of
experiments in which levels are defined from the probabilistic distribution
of the input random vector. More precisely, we show how to create an `Axial`
design of experiments whose points are updated so that they match the mean
and variance of the distribution.

The example here is an axial design of experiments where levels are
proportional to the standard deviation of each component of the random input
vector, and centered on the mean vector of the random input vector.
