Example of sensitivity analyses on the wing weight model
=========================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-20

This example is a brief overview of the use of the most usual sensitivity analysis techniques and how to call them:

- PCC: Partial Correlation Coefficients
- PRCC: Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients
- SRC: Standard Regression Coefficients
- SRRC: Standard Rank Regression Coefficients
- Pearson coefficients
- Spearman coefficients
- Taylor expansion importance factors
- Sobol' indices
- Rank-based estimation of Sobol' indices
- HSIC : Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion

We present the methods on the :ref:`WingWeight function<use-case-wingweight>` and use the same notations.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-29

Definition of the model
-----------------------

We load the model from the usecases module.

Cross cuts of the function
--------------------------

Let's have a look on 2D cross cuts of the wing weight function.
For each 2D cross cut, the other variables are fixed to the input distribution mean values.
This graph allows one to have a first idea of the variations of the function in pair of dimensions.
The colors of each contour plot are comparable. The number of contour levels are related to the amount of variation of the function in the corresponding coordinates.

The different computed correlation estimators show that the variables :math:`S_w, A, N_z, t_c` seem to be the most correlated with the wing weight in absolute value.
Pearson and Spearman coefficients do not reveal any linear nor monotonic correlation as no coefficients are equal to +/- 1.
Coefficients about :math:`t_c` are negative revealing a negative correlation with the wing weight, that is consistent with the model expression.

Furthermore, first order Sobol' indices can also been estimated in a data-driven way using a rank-based sensitivity algorithm.
In such a way, the estimation of sensitivity indices does not involve any surrogate model.

The Sobol' indices confirm the previous analyses, in terms of ranking of the most influent variables.
We also see that five variables have a quasi null total Sobol' indices, that indicates almost no influence on the wing weight.
There is no discrepancy between first order and total Sobol' indices, that indicates no or very low interaction between the variables in the variance of the output.
As the most important variables act only through decoupled first degree contributions, the hypothesis of a linear dependence between the input variables and the weight is legitimate.
This explains why both squared SRC and Taylor give the exact same results even if the first one is based on a :math:`\mathcal{L}^2` linear approximation
and the second one is based on a linear expansion around the mean value of the input variables.

The HSIC indices go in the same way as the other estimators in terms the most influent variables.
The variables :math:`W_{fw}, q, l, W_p` seem to be independent to the output as the corresponding p-values are high.
We can also see that the asymptotic p-values and p-values estimated by permutation are quite similar.
