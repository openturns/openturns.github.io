Customize your Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
============================================

This simple example shows how you can build your own variant
of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-18

We want to sample from the distribution with support :math:`[-3, 3]^2`
whose PDF :math:`f` is proportional to the Ackley function to the tenth power:

.. math::
    \forall \vect{x} \in [-3, 3]^2 \quad f(\vect{x}) \propto a(\vect{x})^{10},

where :math:`a` is the Ackey function defined in :ref:`use-case-ackley` page.
In the following we call it the "Ackley distribution".

Define the proposal distribution as a :class:`~openturns.Histogram`.
Its ticks (on the X axis of the PDF of the histogram) will remain the same,
but its frequencies (on the Y axis) will be updated
during the course of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

The state of the Markov chain must be converted to an acceptable set
of parameters for the :class:`~openturns.Histogram` distribution.
This is the job of the *link function*,
which we construct with the :class:`~openturns.OpenTURNSPythonFunction` class.
It takes a state as input and outputs the parameters (ticks and frequencies)
of the proposal distribution.
In our case, the ticks will not depend on the inputs,
but the frequencies will be outputs of the Ackley function.

        When executed, this function returns the parameters of a Histogram
        which approximates the conditional Ackley distribution obtained
        when one of the 2 coordinates is fixed.
        To compute the frequencies of the Histogram,
        this OpenTURNSPythonFunction computes the values of the Ackley function
        on a regular grid on the line parallel to
        either the (1, 0) vector (if the second coordinate is fixed)
        or the (0, 1) vector (if the first coordinate is fixed)

        The regular grid covers the part of this line which is contained in
        the support of the Ackley distribution, implicitly defined as the
        smallest square that contains the cartesian product of the regular grid
        with itself. For example, if the regular grid covers the interval [-3, 3],
        then the support is the square [-3, 3] x [-3, 3].

The 2 components of the state of the Markov chain will be updated
one after the other, not simultaneously.
We define 2 :class:`~openturns.experimental.UserDefinedMetropolisHastings` algorithms
encapsulated within a :class:`~openturns.Gibbs` algorithm,
so we need 2 link functions, each corresponding to one of the marginals
of the Ackley distribution.

Note that thanks to the :class:`~openturns.OpenTURNSPythonFunction` class,
we were able to only code one template to be used by two different functions
instead of directly coding two functions with the :class:`~openturns.PythonFunction` class.

Let us illustrate the first of these functions.
We can start by evaluating it at :math:`(0.5, 1.5)`.
Let :math:`(X_0, X_1)` be a bidimensional random variable
following the Ackley distribution.
The output is the set of parameters for a :class:`~openturns.Histogram`
distribution that approximates the distribution of :math:`X_0`
conditional on :math:`X_1 = 1.5`.
Let us update the Histogram we created before with this set of parameters.
