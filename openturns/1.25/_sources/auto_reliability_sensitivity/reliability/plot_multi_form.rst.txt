Use the FORM algorithm in case of several design points
=======================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 7-12

Abstract
--------

In this example we showcase the :class:`~openturns.MultiFORM` class which can perform a FORM analysis with several
design points.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 15-18

.. code-block:: Python

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as otv








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-20

We consider a standard bivariate Gaussian random vector :math:`X = (X_1, X_2)` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 20-23

.. code-block:: Python

    dim = 2
    dist = ot.Normal(dim)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-25

We can draw the bidimensional PDF of the distribution `dist` over :math:`[-5,5] \times [-5,5]` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-33

.. code-block:: Python

    ot.ResourceMap.SetAsUnsignedInteger("Contour-DefaultLevelsNumber", 8)
    graphPDF = dist.drawPDF([-5, -5], [5, 5])
    graphPDF.setTitle(r"2D-PDF of the input variables $(X_1, X_2)$")
    graphPDF.setXTitle(r"$x_1$")
    graphPDF.setYTitle(r"$x_2$")
    graphPDF.setLegendPosition("lower right")
    view = otv.View(graphPDF, contour_kw={"norm": "log"})

We then define a model :math:`f` which maps a 2D-vector X = (X_1,X_2) to a
scalar output `Y = f(X)`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-44

.. code-block:: Python

    f = ot.SymbolicFunction(["x0", "x1"], ["5.0-x1-0.5*(x0-0.1)^2"])
    graphModel = f.draw([-8.0, -8.0], [8.0, 8.0])
    graphModel.setXTitle(r"$x_1$")
    graphModel.setXTitle(r"$x_2$")
    graphModel.setTitle(r"Isolines of the model : $Y = f(X)$")
    view = otv.View(graphModel)

We create random vectors for the input and output variables :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-50

.. code-block:: Python

    X = ot.RandomVector(dist)
    Y = ot.CompositeRandomVector(f, X)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-52

The failure domain :math:`\mathcal{D}` is :math:`\mathcal{D} = \{ x=(x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 / f(x) \geq 0 \}`

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-55

.. code-block:: Python

    failureEvent = ot.ThresholdEvent(Y, ot.Less(), 0.0)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-57

We shall represent the failure domain event using a :class:`~openturns.Contour` object.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-70

.. code-block:: Python

    nx, ny = 25, 25
    xx = ot.Box([nx], ot.Interval([-8.0], [8.0])).generate()
    yy = ot.Box([ny], ot.Interval([-8.0], [8.0])).generate()
    inputData = ot.Box([nx, ny], ot.Interval([-8.0, -8.0], [8.0, 8.0])).generate()
    outputData = f(inputData)
    mycontour = ot.Contour(xx, yy, outputData)
    mycontour.setLevels([0.0])
    mycontour.setLabels(["0.0"])
    mycontour.setColor("black")
    mycontour.setLineStyle("dashed")
    graphModel.add(mycontour)

In the physical space the failure domain boundary is the dashed black curve. We recall that one of
the steps of the FORM method is to find the closest point of the failure domain boundary to the origin.
Here we see that the symmetry of the domain implies that two points exist, one in the :math:`x_1 \geq 0` half-space and the other in the :math:`x_1 \leq 0` half-space.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-79

We build the :class:`~openturns.MultiFORM` algorithm in a similar fashion as the :class:`~openturns.FORM` algorithm.
We choose an optimization solver, here the Cobyla solver, and a starting point, the mean of the distribution `dist`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-84

.. code-block:: Python

    solver = ot.Cobyla()
    solver.setStartingPoint(dist.getMean())
    algo = ot.MultiFORM(solver, failureEvent)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-86

We are ready to run the algorithm and store the result in the :class:`~openturns.MultiFORM` class :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-89

.. code-block:: Python

    algo.run()
    result = algo.getResult()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-91

We have access to the results with the getFORMResultCollection method which produces a collection of :class:`~openturns.FORMResult` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-93

.. code-block:: Python

    coll = result.getFORMResultCollection()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 94-95

The length of this collection is the number of design points :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 95-99

.. code-block:: Python

    n_design_pts = len(coll)
    print("Number of design points :", n_design_pts)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Number of design points : 2




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 100-102

We have access to the design points with the getPhysicalSpaceDesignPoint method for each element of
the collection `coll`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 102-107

.. code-block:: Python

    designPointPhysicalSpace1 = coll[0].getPhysicalSpaceDesignPoint()
    designPointPhysicalSpace2 = coll[1].getPhysicalSpaceDesignPoint()

We visualize them on the previous graph with red circle dots.

We recall that the FORM approximate is based on the substitution of the failure domain by the half-space defined by the tangent at the design point.
Here we can clearly see that this would miss half of the information. That is why both design points are needed.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 128-129

For each design point we have a probability associated to the approximation by the half-space :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 129-132

.. code-block:: Python

    pf1 = coll[0].getEventProbability()
    pf2 = coll[1].getEventProbability()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 133-134

The probability of failure is the given by the :meth:`~openturns.MultiFORMResult.getEventProbability` which is the sum of the two previous probabilities `pf1` and `pf2` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 134-139

.. code-block:: Python

    pf = result.getEventProbability()
    print("Probability of failure : ", pf)
    print("    wrt design point 1 : ", pf1)
    print("    wrt design point 2 : ", pf2)
