The HSIC sensitivity indices: the Ishigami model
================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 5-11

    import openturns as ot

    from openturns.usecases import ishigami_function









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-15

This example is a brief overview of the HSIC sensitivity indices classes and how to call them.
HSIC estimators rely on a reproducing kernel of a Hilbert space. We can use them to compute sensitivity
indices. We present the methods on the :ref:`Ishigami function<use-case-ishigami>`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 18-22

Definition of the model
-----------------------

We load the model from the usecases module.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-24

.. code-block:: Python

    im = ishigami_function.IshigamiModel()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-26

We generate an input sample of size 100 (and dimension 3).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-29

.. code-block:: Python

    size = 100
    X = im.inputDistribution.getSample(size)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 30-31

We compute the output by applying the Ishigami model to the input sample.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-34

.. code-block:: Python

    Y = im.model(X)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-45

Setting the covariance models
-----------------------------

The HSIC algorithms use reproducing kernels defined on Hilbert spaces to estimate independence.
For each input variable we choose a covariance kernel.
Here we choose a :class:`~openturns.SquaredExponential`
kernel for all input variables.

They are all stored in a list of :math:`d+1` covariance kernels where :math:`d` is the number of
input variables. The remaining one is for the output variable.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-47

.. code-block:: Python

    covarianceModelCollection = []








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-54

.. code-block:: Python

    for i in range(3):
        Xi = X.getMarginal(i)
        inputCovariance = ot.SquaredExponential(1)
        inputCovariance.setScale(Xi.computeStandardDeviation())
        covarianceModelCollection.append(inputCovariance)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 55-56

Likewise we define a covariance kernel associated to the output variable.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-60

.. code-block:: Python

    outputCovariance = ot.SquaredExponential(1)
    outputCovariance.setScale(Y.computeStandardDeviation())
    covarianceModelCollection.append(outputCovariance)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-66

The Global HSIC estimator
-------------------------

In this paragraph, we perform the analysis on the raw data: that is
the global HSIC estimator.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-80

Choosing an estimator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After having defined the covariance kernels one has to select an
appropriate estimator for the computations.

Two estimators are proposed:

- an unbiased estimator through the :class:`~openturns.HSICUStat` class
- a biased, but asymptotically unbiased, estimator through the :class:`~openturns.HSICVStat` class

Beware that the conditional analysis used later cannot be performed with the unbiased estimator.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 80-83

.. code-block:: Python

    estimatorType = ot.HSICUStat()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 84-85

We now build the HSIC estimator:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-89

.. code-block:: Python

    globHSIC = ot.HSICEstimatorGlobalSensitivity(
        covarianceModelCollection, X, Y, estimatorType

The Target HSIC estimator
-------------------------

We now perform the target analysis which consists in using a filter function over the
output.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 134-140

Defining a filter function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We define a filter function on the output variable for the target
analysis. In this example we use the function :math:`\exp{(-d/s)}` where :math:`d` is the distance
to a well-chosen interval.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 142-143

We first define a critical domain: in our case that is the :math:`[5,+\infty[` interval.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 143-145

.. code-block:: Python

    criticalDomain = ot.Interval(5, float("inf"))








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 146-148

We have access to the distance to this  domain thanks to the
:class:`~openturns.DistanceToDomainFunction` class.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 148-150

.. code-block:: Python

    dist2criticalDomain = ot.DistanceToDomainFunction(criticalDomain)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 151-152

We define the empirical parameter values in our function from the output sample

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 152-154

.. code-block:: Python

    s = 0.1 * Y.computeStandardDeviation()[0]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 155-157

We now define our filter function by composition of the parametrized function and
the distance function.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 157-161

.. code-block:: Python

    f = ot.SymbolicFunction(["x", "s"], ["exp(-x/s)"])
    phi = ot.ParametricFunction(f, [1], [s])
    filterFunction = ot.ComposedFunction(phi, dist2criticalDomain)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 162-163

We modify the output covariance kernel so as to adapt it to the filtered output

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 163-167

.. code-block:: Python

    Y_filtered = filterFunction(Y)
    outputCovariance.setScale(Y_filtered.computeStandardDeviation())
    covarianceModelCollection[-1] = outputCovariance

The Conditional HSIC estimator
------------------------------

In this last section we preprocess the input variables: that is the conditional
analysis. To do so, one has to work with a weight function.
Here the weight function is the filter function we used previously.
