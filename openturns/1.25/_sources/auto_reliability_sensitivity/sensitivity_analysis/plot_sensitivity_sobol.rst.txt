Estimate Sobol' indices for the Ishigami function by a sampling method: a quick start guide to sensitivity analysis
===================================================================================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 7-10

In this example, we estimate the Sobol' indices for the
:ref:`Ishigami function <use-case-ishigami>` by sampling methods.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 13-52

Introduction
------------

In this example we are going to quantify the correlation between the input
variables and the output variable of a model thanks to Sobol indices.

Sobol indices are designed to evaluate the importance of a single variable
or a specific set of variables.
Here the Sobol indices are estimated by sampling from the distributions of
the input variables and propagating uncertainty through a function.

In theory, Sobol indices range from 0 to 1; the closer an index value is
to 1, the better the associated input variable explains the function output.

Let us denote by :math:`d` the input dimension of the model.

Sobol' indices can be computed at different orders.

* First order indices evaluate the importance of one input variable
  at a time.

* Total indices give the relative importance of one input variable
  and all its interactions with other variables.
  Alternatively, they can be viewed as measuring how much wriggle room
  remains to the output when all but one input variables are fixed.

* In general, we are only interested in first order and total Sobol' indices.
  There are situations, however, where we want to estimate interactions.
  Second order indices evaluate the importance of every pair of input variables.
  The number of second order indices is:

.. math::
   \binom{d}{2} = \frac{d \times \left( d-1\right)}{2}.

In practice, when the number of input variables is not small (say,
when :math:`d>5`), then the number of second order indices is too large
to be easily analyzed.
In these situations, we limit the analysis to the first order and total
Sobol' indices.

Define the model
----------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-65

.. code-block:: Python

    from openturns.usecases import ishigami_function
    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer
    import openturns.viewer as viewer
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-67

We load the Ishigami model from the usecases model :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-69

.. code-block:: Python

    im = ishigami_function.IshigamiModel()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-74

The :class:`~openturns.usecases.ishigami_function.IshigamiModel` data class contains the input distribution
:math:`\vect{X}=(X_1, X_2, X_3)` in `im.inputDistribution` and the Ishigami
function in `im.model`.
We also have access to the input variable names with:

.. code-block:: Python

    input_names = im.inputDistribution.getDescription()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-79

Draw the function
-----------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-85

.. code-block:: Python

    n = 10000
    sampleX = im.inputDistribution.getSample(n)
    sampleY = im.model(sampleX)

Display relationships between the output and the inputs

We see that the distribution of the output has two modes.

Estimate the Sobol' indices
---------------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 104-108

We first create a design of experiments with the `SobolIndicesExperiment`.
Since we are not interested in second order indices for the moment,
we use the default value of the third argument (we will come back to this
topic later).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-117

    size = 1000
    sie = ot.SobolIndicesExperiment(im.inputDistribution, size)

    inputDesign.setDescription(input_names)
    inputDesign.getSize()

    5000



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 118-120

We see that 5000 function evaluations are required to estimate the first
order and total Sobol' indices.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 122-123

Then we evaluate the outputs corresponding to this design of experiments.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 125-127

.. code-block:: Python

    outputDesign = im.model(inputDesign)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 128-129

Then we estimate the Sobol' indices with the `SaltelliSensitivityAlgorithm`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 131-133

.. code-block:: Python

    sensitivityAnalysis = ot.SaltelliSensitivityAlgorithm(inputDesign, outputDesign, size)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 134-135

Let us estimate first order and total Sobol' indices.

- We see that the variable :math:`X_1`, with a total Sobol' index close
  to 0.6, is the most significant variable, taking into account both its direct
  effect and its interactions with other variables.
  Its first order index is close to 0.3, which implies that its interactions
  alone produce almost 30% (0.6 - 0.3) of the total variance.
- The variable :math:`X_2` has the highest first order index: approximately 0.4.
  However, it has little interaction with other variables since its total
  order index is close to its first order index.
- The variable :math:`X_3` has a first order index close to zero.
  However, it has an impact on the total variance thanks to its interactions
  with :math:`X_1`.
- We see that the variability of the estimates is quite high even with a
  relatively large sample size.
  Moreover, since the exact first order Sobol' index for :math:`X_3` is zero,
  its estimate has a 50% chance of being nonpositive.

Estimate the second order indices
---------------------------------

.. code-block:: Python

    size = 1000
    computeSecondOrder = True
    sie = ot.SobolIndicesExperiment(im.inputDistribution, size, computeSecondOrder)

    print(inputDesign.getSize())
    inputDesign.setDescription(input_names)
    outputDesign = im.model(inputDesign)

    8000




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 181-183

We see that 8000 function evaluations are now required; that is 3000 more
evaluations than in the previous situation.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 185-187

.. code-block:: Python

    sensitivityAnalysis = ot.SaltelliSensitivityAlgorithm(inputDesign, outputDesign, size)

    second_order = sensitivityAnalysis.getSecondOrderIndices()
    for i in range(im.dim):
        for j in range(i):
            print("2nd order index (%d,%d)=%g" % (i, j, second_order[i, j]))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    2nd order index (1,0)=-0.0805798
    2nd order index (2,0)=0.0914596
    2nd order index (2,1)=-0.0988192




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 194-196

This shows that the only significant interaction is the one between :math:`X_1`
and :math:`X_3` (beware of Python's index shift: 0 denotes the first input variable).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 198-209

Using a different estimator
---------------------------

We have used the `SaltelliSensitivityAlgorithm` class to estimate the indices.
Others are available in the library:

* `SaltelliSensitivityAlgorithm`
* `MartinezSensitivityAlgorithm`
* `JansenSensitivityAlgorithm`
* `MauntzKucherenkoSensitivityAlgorithm`


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 211-213

In order to compare the results with another method, we use the
`MartinezSensitivityAlgorithm` class.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 215-217

.. code-block:: Python

    sensitivityAnalysis = ot.MartinezSensitivityAlgorithm(inputDesign, outputDesign, size)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 218-222
