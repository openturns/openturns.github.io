Sort a sample
=============

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 7-8

In this example we present useful methods of the :class:`~openturns.Sample` object such as marginals extraction and various sorting strategies.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 11-13

.. code-block:: Python

    import openturns as ot








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-15

We start by defining the distribution of a regular non-biased die.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 15-17

.. code-block:: Python

    die_distribution = ot.UserDefined([[i] for i in range(1, 7)])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 18-19

We consider now an experiment with two independent dice and build the corresponding random vector :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-21

.. code-block:: Python

    two_dice_distribution = ot.JointDistribution([die_distribution] * 2)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-23

We now build a sample of size :math:`n=5` from this distribution :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-27

.. code-block:: Python

    n = 5
    sample = two_dice_distribution.getSample(n)
    print(sample)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

        [ v0 X0 ]
    0 : [ 1  3  ]
    1 : [ 3  2  ]
    2 : [ 4  3  ]
    3 : [ 4  4  ]
    4 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-30

Useful methods
--------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-33

We have access to the marginals by providing a list of the wanted indices :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-40

.. code-block:: Python


    # the first marginal
    sample_die1 = sample.getMarginal([0])

    # the second marginal
    sample_die2 = sample.getMarginal([1])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 41-43

Suppose we are interested in the sum of the two dice. This can be done by summing the two samples `die1` and `die2`.
Provided the dimensions are the same we can add samples with the `+` operator and produce a new sample :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-45

.. code-block:: Python

    experiment = sample_die1 + sample_die2








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-47

Note that the `+=` operator is defined as well.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-50

We can concatenate two samples having the same size with the `stack` method :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-53

.. code-block:: Python

    sample_die1.stack(sample_die2)
    print(sample_die1)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

        [ v0 X0 ]
    0 : [ 1  3  ]
    1 : [ 3  2  ]
    2 : [ 4  3  ]
    3 : [ 4  4  ]
    4 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-55

We can split a sample in two by giving an index (here 2).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 55-60

.. code-block:: Python

    remaining = sample_die1.split(2)
    print(sample_die1)
    print(remaining)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

        [ v0 X0 ]
    0 : [ 1  3  ]
    1 : [ 3  2  ]
        [ v0 X0 ]
    0 : [ 4  3  ]
    1 : [ 4  4  ]
    2 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-63

Sorting samples
---------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-67

We can extract any marginal and sort it by ascending order by specifying the index :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-70

.. code-block:: Python

    sorted_marginal = sample.sort(1)
    print(sorted_marginal)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    0 : [ 2 ]
    1 : [ 3 ]
    2 : [ 3 ]
    3 : [ 4 ]
    4 : [ 5 ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 71-73

We can sort the sample in place, that is without creating a new sample, as well with `sortInPlace`.
When the dimension is greater than one the sort is made according to the first marginal.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-76

.. code-block:: Python

    sample.sortInPlace()
    print(sample)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

        [ v0 X0 ]
    0 : [ 1  3  ]
    1 : [ 3  2  ]
    2 : [ 4  3  ]
    3 : [ 4  4  ]
    4 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-78

We can sort the rows according to the second marginal with the `sortAccordingToAComponent` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-81

.. code-block:: Python

    another_sample = sample.sortAccordingToAComponent(1)
    print(another_sample)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

        [ v0 X0 ]
    0 : [ 3  2  ]
    1 : [ 1  3  ]
    2 : [ 4  3  ]
    3 : [ 4  4  ]
    4 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-83

There is also a `sortAccordingToAComponentInPlace` method that does the same without creating a new sample.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-86

We can sort and remove the duplicates at the same time

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-89

.. code-block:: Python

    print(sample_die2)
    print(sample_die2.sortUnique())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

        [ X0 ]
    0 : [ 3  ]
    1 : [ 2  ]
    2 : [ 3  ]
    3 : [ 4  ]
    4 : [ 5  ]
        [ X0 ]
    0 : [ 2  ]
    1 : [ 3  ]
    2 : [ 4  ]
    3 : [ 5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-91

We note that the sample is smaller as expected. Sorting in place is also possible :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-94

.. code-block:: Python

    sample_die2.sortUniqueInPlace()
    print(sample_die2)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

        [ X0 ]
    0 : [ 2  ]
    1 : [ 3  ]
    2 : [ 4  ]
    3 : [ 5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 95-96

Let's try with the sample in dimension 2 :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 96-99

.. code-block:: Python

    sampleUnique = sample.sortUnique()
    print(sampleUnique)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

        [ v0 X0 ]
    0 : [ 1  3  ]
    1 : [ 3  2  ]
    2 : [ 4  3  ]
    3 : [ 4  4  ]
    4 : [ 5  5  ]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 100-101

Nothing happens here because pairs are already unique !
