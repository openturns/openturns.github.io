Various design of experiments
=============================

The goal of this example is to present several design of experiments available in the library.

In order to see the LHS property, we need to set the bounds.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-80

We see that each column or row exactly contains one single point.
This shows that a LHS design of experiments has good 1D projection properties, and, hence, is a good candidate for a space filling design.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-84

Optimized LHS
-------------

We see that this LHS is optimized in the sense that it fills the space more evenly than a non-optimized does in general.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 134-137

We have elementary intervals in 2 dimensions, each having a volume equal to 1/8.
Since there are 32 points, the Sobol' sequence is so that each elementary interval contains exactly 32/8 = 4 points.
Notice that each elementary interval is closed on the left (or bottom) and open on the right (or top).

We have elementary intervals in 2 dimensions, each having a volume equal to 1/12.
Since there are 36 points, the Halton sequence is so that each elementary interval contains exactly 36/12 = 3 points.
