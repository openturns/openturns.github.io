Plot Smolyak multi-indices
==========================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 7-26

The goal of this example is to plot the multi-indices used in Smolyak's
quadrature.

For a given dimension :math:`d_x \in \mathbb{N}` and a given level
:math:`\ell \in \mathbb{N}`
Smolyak's quadrature is the combination of tensorized univariate quadratures.
These quadrature are defined by the set of multi-indices:

.. math::

    \mathcal{S}_{\ell, d_x} = \left\{\|\boldsymbol{k}\|_1 \leq \ell
                                     + d_x - 1\right\}

where :math:`\|\boldsymbol{k}\|_1 = k_1 + ... + k_{d_x}` is the 1-norm of the
multi-index :math:`\boldsymbol{k} \in \mathbb{N}^{d_x}`.

The goal of this script is to plot the multi-indices involved in Smolyak's
quadrature for different values of the level :math:`\ell` in
dimension :math:`d_x = 2`.

In the first example, we print the indices involved in
Smolyak-Legendre quadrature of level 3.
The multi-indices are computed using the
:py:meth:`openturns.SmolyakExperiment.computeCombination` method.
Actually, the multi-indices do not actually depend on the
underlying univariate quadratures, but this is required for
the :class:`openturns.SmolyakExperiment` class.

    print(indices)

We see that the multi-indices have a sum which is equal to either 3 or 4.
In other words, these multi-indices belong to two different layers of
constant 1-norms.

In order to see how this evolves depending on the level of the quadrature,
the following function creates a 2D plot of the set of multi-indices.

In the following script, we create a grid of plots, where
each graph corresponds to a given quadrature level.
The bounding box of each graph is set to a constant value, so that all graphs
have the same X and Y bounds.

We see that when the level increases, the set of Smolyak multi-indices
correspond to two different layers of constant 1-norm.
This is a consequence of Smolyak's quadrature, which is based on
tensorization of univariate difference quadratures.
