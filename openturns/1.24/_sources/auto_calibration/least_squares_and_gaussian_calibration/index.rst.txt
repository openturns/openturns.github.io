    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="We present a calibration study of the logistic growth model defined use-case-logistic. The data set that we use is the U.S. population from 1790 to 2000. One of the specific properties of this study is that the observations that we use are real world observations. Hence when we calibrate the model on the data, there is a discrepancy that will be seen. In this example, we calibrate the parameters of a model which predicts the dynamics of the size of a population. This shows how we can calibrate a model which predicts a time dependent output. The output of the model is a time series representing the evolution of the population. This requires a transpose of the sample, so that we can benefit from the visualization methods.">

Hence, all methods perform correctly in this case.">
