Create a white noise process
============================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-26

This example details how to create and manipulate a white noise.
A second order white noise
:math:`\varepsilon: \Omega \times \mathbb{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d` is a stochastic
process of dimension :math:`d` such that the covariance function
:math:`C(\underline{s},\underline{t})=\delta(\underline{t}-\underline{s})C(\underline{s},\underline{s})`
where :math:`C(\underline{s},\underline{s})` is the covariance matrix of the process at
vertex :math:`\underline{s}` and :math:`\delta` the Kroenecker function.

A process :math:`\varepsilon` is a white noise if all finite family of
locations :math:`(\underline{t}_i)_{i=1, \dots, n} \in \mathbb{D}`,
:math:`(\varepsilon_{\underline{t}_i})_{i=1, \dots, n}` is independent and
identically distributed.

The library proposes to model it through the object *WhiteNoise* defined
on a mesh and a distribution with zero mean and finite standard
deviation.

If the distribution has a mean different from zero, The library writes
message to prevent the User and does not allow the creation of such a
white noise.
