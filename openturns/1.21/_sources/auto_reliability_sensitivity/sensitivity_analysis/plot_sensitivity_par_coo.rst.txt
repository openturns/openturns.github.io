Parallel coordinates graph as sensitivity tool
==============================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-28

The parallel coordinates graph enables to visualize all the combinations of the input
variables which lead to a specific range of the output variable.

Let us consider a model :math:`f: \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}`, where :math:`f(\underline{X}) = Y`.

The graph requires to have an input sample :math:`X_s` and an output sample :math:`Y_s`.

The first figure draws such a graph: each column represents one component
:math:`X_i` of the input vector :math:`\underline{X}`.
The last column represents the scalar output variable :math:`Y`.
For each point :math:`\underline{X}^j`, each component :math:`X_i^j`
is noted on its respective axe and the last mark is the one which corresponds to
the associated :math:`Y^j`. A line joins all the marks. Thus, each point of the sample
corresponds to a particular line on the graph.

The scale of the axes are quantile based: each axe runs between 0 and 1 and each
value is represented by its quantile with respect to its marginal empirical distribution.

It is interesting to select, among those lines, the ones which correspond to a specific range of the output variable.
These particular lines are colored differently.
This specific range is defined in the quantile based scale of :math:`Y` or in its specific scale.
In that second case, the range is automatically converted into a quantile based scale range.
