Create a Gauss product design
=============================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-7

In this example we are going to create a deterministic weighted design experiment using Gauss product.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 9-15

.. code-block:: Python

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as viewer
    from matplotlib import pylab as plt

    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-17

Define the underlying distribution, degrees

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 17-22

.. code-block:: Python

    distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution(
        [ot.Exponential(), ot.Triangular(-1.0, -0.5, 1.0)]
    )
    marginalSizes = [15, 8]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-24

Create the design

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-27

.. code-block:: Python

    experiment = ot.GaussProductExperiment(distribution, marginalSizes)
    sample = experiment.generate()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-29

Plot the design

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-34

.. code-block:: Python

    graph = ot.Graph("GP design", "x1", "x2", True, "")
    cloud = ot.Cloud(sample, "blue", "fsquare", "")
    graph.add(cloud)
    view = viewer.View(graph)
    plt.show()
