An illustrated example of a FORM probability estimate
=====================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 7-14

Abstract
--------

In this example we illustrate the different steps of a FORM/SORM analysis on a
simple example. We focus on the different steps and compare them with an analytic
computation whenever possible.

Position of the problem
-----------------------

We consider a bivariate random vector :math:`X = (X_1, X_2)` with the following independent marginals:

- an exponential distribution with parameter :math:`\lambda=1`, :math:`X_1 \sim \mathcal{E}(1.0)` ;
- a standard unit gaussian :math:`X_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)`.

The support of the input vector is :math:`[0, +\infty[ \times \mathbb{R}`

We consider the model :math:`f : (x_1, x_2) \mapsto x_1 x_2` which maps the random input vector :math:`X` to the output variable :math:`Y=f(X) \in \mathbb{R}`.
We also draw the isolines of the model `f`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-69

We want to estimate the probability :math:`P_f` of the output variable to be greater than a prescribed threshold :math:`s=10` : this is the failure event.
This probability is simply expressed as an integral:

.. math::

   P_f = \int_{\mathcal{D}} \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{D}}(x) df_{X_1,X_2}(x)

where :math:`\mathcal{D} = \{ (x_1, x_2) \in [0,+\infty[ \times \mathbb{R} / x_1 x_2 \geq s \}` is the failure domain.
In the general case the probability density function :math:`f_{X_1,X_2}` and the domain of integration :math:`\mathcal{D}` are difficult to handle.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 71-72

We first define RandomVector objects and the failure event associated to the output random variable.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-78

.. code-block:: Python

    vectorX = ot.RandomVector(distX)
    vectorY = ot.CompositeRandomVector(f, vectorX)
    s = 10.0
    event = ot.ThresholdEvent(vectorY, ot.Greater(), s)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-86

This event can easily be represented with a 1D curve as it is a branch of an hyperbole.
If :math:`y =  x_1 x_2 = 10.0`, then the boundary of the domain of failure is the curve :

.. math::

   h : x_1 \mapsto \frac{10.0}{x_1}


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 88-89

We shall represent this curve using a :class:`~openturns.Contour` object.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-119

From the previous figure we observe that in the failure domain the PDF takes small (and even very small) values.
Consequently the probability of the failure, the integral :math:`P_f` is also expected to be small.
The FORM/SORM methods estimate this kind of integral.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 121-137

The FORM approximation
----------------------

The basic steps of the FORM (or SORM) algorithm are :

- an isoprobabilistic transform ;
- finding the design point : that is the nearest point wrt the origin in the standard space ;
- estimating the probability integral.

As mentioned, both the density function and the domain of integration are complex in general.
The first step of the FORM method makes the density easier to work with and the second step tackles
the domain of integration problem.

Variable transform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 139-142

OpenTURNS has several isoprobabilistic transforms and the FORM/SORM classes implement the Generalized
Nataf and Rosenblatt transforms. In this case the `distX` distribution is not elliptical so the default method is the Rosenblatt transform.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 142-144

.. code-block:: Python

    print("Is Elliptical ? ", distX.isElliptical())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Is Elliptical ?  False




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 145-153

We seek an isoprobabilistic transform :math:`T` such as

.. math::
   T : X \mapsto Z

where each component of :math:`Z` is a standard unit gaussian.

The isoprobabilistic transform and its inverse are methods of the distribution `distX` :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 153-156

.. code-block:: Python

    transformation = distX.getIsoProbabilisticTransformation()
    inverseTransformation = distX.getInverseIsoProbabilisticTransformation()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 157-161

The main goal of this step is to work with a simpler probability density function of
the input variables as they will be standard gaussian unit and uncorrelated. The domain of
integration will still be complicated but will be handled with a well chosen approximate.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 163-168

We detail the Rosenblatt transform in this simple case.
In this example we consider independent variables so the transform is simpler, we only have to
perform the transformation on each variable. For the second one is already a standard unit gaussian
we transform the first variable only.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 170-172

We draw a realization of the random input vector. This point is said to be in the physical space.
We shall focus on the first component.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 172-174

.. code-block:: Python

    xi = vectorX.getRealization()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 175-179

The first step of the Rosenblatt transform is to build a random variable :math:`u` with a uniform law in ]0,1[.
This is done through an evaluation of the CDF of `distX1` at the given point in the physical space.
Once again, please note that the second component is left unchanged.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 179-181

.. code-block:: Python

    ui = [distX1.computeCDF(xi[0]), xi[1]]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 182-184

The second step is to build a standard unit gaussian from a uniform variable. This is done by a
simple call to the probit function. The point `zi` is said to be in the standard space.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 184-186

.. code-block:: Python

    zi = [-ot.Normal().computeInverseSurvivalFunction(ui[0])[0], ui[1]]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 187-188

The sought transform then maps a point in the physical space to the standard space :

The design point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The FORM and SORM methods assume that the failure probability integral has its support in
the vicinity of the closest point of the domain to the origin.
Then the second step of the method is to find this point, *the design point*, through a
minimization problem under constraints.

Estimating the failure probability integral
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The last step of the FORM algorithm is to replace the domain of integration by the half-space at
the design point. In this simple example the half-space is delimited by the tangent at the design
point in the standard space.

The expression of the failure domain boundary in the standard space is the composition of the
hyperbole :math:`h:x \mapsto 10/x` and the inverse transform on the first variable. We can compute
the gradient (here the first derivative of a 1D function :math:`h(u_0)` ) at any given point with the
getGradient method :

The SORM approximation
----------------------

The SORM approximate uses an osculating paraboloid instead of the half-space delimited by the
tangent at the design point. In this case it is a simple parabola we can obtain through Taylor expansion at the design point.
However, in the general case one has to manipulate the gradient and the hessian in the
standard space which is cumbersome.

We build the SORM algorithm and run it :

.. code-block:: Python

    algoSORM = ot.SORM(solver, event, distX.getMean())
    algoSORM.run()

The SORM result is obtained with the `getResult` method :

    resultSORM = algoSORM.getResult()

The principal curvatures of the osculating paraboloid at the design point is obtained by the
`getSortedCurvatures` method :

    print("Curvature (estimated) = ", resultSORM.getSortedCurvatures()[1])

Once the curvature is obtained there are several ways of approximating the failure probability :math:`P_f`.
The library implements the Breitung, Hohenbichler and Tvedt estimates.

For instance, the Breitung approximation gives

.. math::

   P_f \approx E(\beta_{HL}) \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\beta_{HL}\kappa}}


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 444-448

.. code-block:: Python

    coeff = (1.0 + betaHL * curvature) ** (-0.5)
    pf = (1.0 - ot.Normal().computeCDF(betaHL)) * coeff
    print("SORM : Pf = ", pf)

We can compare with the different estimators implemented in OpenTURNS :

    pfBreitung = resultSORM.getEventProbabilityBreitung()
    pfHohenbichler = resultSORM.getEventProbabilityHohenbichler()
