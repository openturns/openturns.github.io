The first time the method is evaluated, the active multiindex set is empty, so that it must be filled with the first coefficients in the multiindex set, according to the enumeration rule.

        "The previous text (and a detailed analysis of the output file) allows to understand what exactly happens in the algorithm. To understand each step, note that the significant threshold is equal to $\\epsilon = 10^{-10}$.\n\n- During the initialization, the initial basis is empty and filled with the indices [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The greatest coefficient in absolute value is $a_0 = 3.505$, which leads to the threshold $\\epsilon |a_0| = 3.505 \\times 10^{-10}$. Most of the considered coefficient are, however, too close to zero. This is why only the coefficients [0, 1, 7, 10, 15] are kept in the basis. The corresponding coefficients are [3.505, 1.625,-0.6414, -1.291, 1.372].\n- On step 1, the candidate index 16 is considered. Its coefficient is $a_{16} = -1.197 \\times 10^{-15}$, which is much too low to be selected. Hence, the basis is unchanged and the active multiindex set is [0, 1, 7, 10, 15] on the end of this step.\n- From the step 3 to the step 15, the active multiindex set is unchanged, because no considered coefficient becomes greater than the threshold.\n- On step 16, the candidate index 30 is considered, with corresponding coefficient $a_{30} = -1.612$. Since this coefficient has an absolute value greater than the threshold, it gets selected and the active multiindex set is [0, 1, 7, 10, 15, 30] on the end of this step. From this step to the end, the index 30 will not leave the active set. \n- On the step 20, the index 35 enters the active set. \n- On the step 25, the index 40 enters the active set. \n- On the step 34, the index 49 enters the active set. \n- On the step 69, the index 84 enters the active set. \n- On the step 74, the index 89 enters the active set. \n- On the step 83, the index 98 enters the active set. \n- On the last step, the active multiindex set contains the indices [0, 1, 7, 10, 15, 30, 35, 40, 49, 84, 89, 98] and the corresponding coefficients are [3.508, 1.625, -0.6414, -1.291, 1.372, -1.613, 0.2076, -1.090, 0.4092, -0.2078, 0.1753, -0.3250].\n\nWe see that the algorithm was able so select 12 coefficients in the first 101 coefficients considered by the algorithm. It could have selected more coefficients since we provided 16 slots to fill thanks to the `mostSignificant` parameter. The considered coefficients were, however, too close to zero and were below the threshold.\n\n"
