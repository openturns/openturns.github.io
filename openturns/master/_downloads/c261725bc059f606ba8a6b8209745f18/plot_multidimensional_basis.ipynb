        "## Description\n\nWe want to build a finite basis of functions $\\mathcal{B}=\\{f_1,...,f_n\\}$ where each\n$f_i: \\mathbb{R}^d \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^q$ with $d>1, q>1$, from given scalar multivariable\nfunctions $g_i: \\mathbb{R}^d \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn other words, we want to create a basis of functions having both a multivariate input *and* output from\nfunctions having a multivariate input and a scalar output.\n\nIn this example, we do that by the aggregation of the given functions $g_i$,\nusing the :class:`~openturns.AggregatedFunction` class. This class allows one to create a multivariate output\nfunction from a list of functions having a univariate output dimension. Note that we can only aggregate functions\nthat share the same input space.\n\nWe illustrate two cases that differ from the way the functions $g_i$ have been created:\n\n- Case 1: we suppose that the functions $g_i$ have no particular origin,\n- Case 2: we suppose that the functions $g_i$ have been built from particular bases.\n\nIn both cases, we use the :class:`~openturns.Basis` class to create the basis and the\n:class:`~openturns.AggregatedFunction` class to create a multivariate output function from a\nlist of scalar multivariable functions.\n\n## Case 1: Aggregation of given functions\n\nIn that case, we have some functions $g_i: \\mathbb{R}^d \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ and we aggregate them\nin order to build the basis $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nFor example, we set $d=2$, $q=3$ and we use the functions $(g_1, g_2, g_3)$ defined by:\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{array}{lcl}\n      g_1(x_1, x_2) & = & 1\\\\\n      g_2(x_1, x_2) & = & x_1 + x_2\\\\\n      g_3(x_1, x_2) & = & x_1^2 + x_2^2\n    \\end{array}\\end{align}\n\nand we want to build the finite basis $\\mathcal{B}=\\{f_1,f_2\\}$ defined by:\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{array}{lcl}\n      f_1(x_1, x_2) & = & (1, 1, 1)\\\\\n      f_2(x_1, x_2) & = & (1, x_1 + x_2, x_1^2 + x_2^2)\n    \\end{array}\\end{align}\n\n"

For example, they are members of polynomial families which are orthonormal\nto given distributions.\n\nIn this example, we use both polynomial families:\n\n- $(g_1^i)_{i\\geq 0}$ which is a orthonormal multivariate polynomial basis with respect to the uniform\n  distributipn on $[-1,1]^d$ (it is obtained through a tensor product of univariate Legendre polynomials\n  orthonormal with respect to the uniform distribution on $[-1,1]$),\n- $(g_2^i)_{i\\geq 0}$ which is a orthonormal multivariate polynomial basis with respect to the multivariate\n  standard normal distribution (it is obtained through a tensor product of univariate Hermite polynomials\n  orthonormal with respect to the standard normal univariate distribution).\n\nWe consider the linear\nenumeration of the polynomial family. The functions $f_i$ are built as the aggregation of\nthe $i$-th polynomials of the families $(g_1^k)_k$ and $(g_2^k)_k$.\nWe only consider $g_1^i$ and $g_2^i$ of total degree less than 2:\nthen we have 6 polynomials $f_i$.\n\nWe still set $d=2$, $q=3$.\n\n"
