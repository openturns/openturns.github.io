Create a gaussian process from a cov. model using HMatrix
=========================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-7

In this basic example we are going to build a gaussian process from its covariance model and using the `HMatrix` as sampling method.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 13-19

    from __future__ import print_function
    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as viewer
    from matplotlib import pylab as plt
    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)

Define the covariance model :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-28

.. code-block:: default

    dimension = 1
    amplitude = [1.0] * dimension
    scale = [10] * dimension
    covarianceModel = ot.AbsoluteExponential(scale, amplitude)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-30

Define the time grid on which we want to sample the gaussian process :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-33

define a mesh

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-38

.. code-block:: default

    tmin = 0.0
    step = 0.01
    n = 10001
    timeGrid = ot.RegularGrid(tmin, step, n)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-40

Finally define the gaussian process :

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-43

create the process

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-46

.. code-block:: default

    process = ot.GaussianProcess(covarianceModel, timeGrid)
    print(process)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    GaussianProcess(trend=[x0]->[0.0], covariance=AbsoluteExponential(scale=[10], amplitude=[1]))




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-48

We set the sampling method to `HMAT`

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-52

.. code-block:: default

    process.setSamplingMethod(1)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-54

We sample the process : 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-57

draw a sample

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-62

.. code-block:: default

    sample = process.getSample(6)
    graph = sample.drawMarginal(0)
    view = viewer.View(graph)
    plt.show()

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-64

We notice here that we are able to sample the covariance model over a mesh of size `10000`, which is usually tricky on laptop. This is mainly due to the compression.
