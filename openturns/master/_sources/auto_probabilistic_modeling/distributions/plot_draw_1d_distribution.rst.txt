Draw 1-d distribution graphs
============================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-7

In this example we are going to draw PDF and CDF of an unidimensional distribution.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 9-19

    from __future__ import print_function
    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as viewer
    from matplotlib import pylab as plt

    # assume an 1-d distribution
    distribution = ot.Gumbel(0.45, 0.6)
    print(distribution)

draw PDF

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-27

.. code-block:: default

    graph = distribution.drawPDF()
    # IMPORTANT: note that this command just generates the graph data
    # and is only drawn in the context of Jupyter notebooks.
    # To plot from a script, see the viewer module.
    view = viewer.View(graph)
