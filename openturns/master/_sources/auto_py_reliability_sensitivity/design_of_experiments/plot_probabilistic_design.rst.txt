Probabilistic design of experiments
===================================

In this example we are going to expose the available probabilistic design of experiments generated according to a specified distribution and a specified number of points.


.. code-block:: default

    from __future__ import print_function
    import openturns as ot
    import math as m
    import openturns.viewer as viewer
    from matplotlib import pylab as plt
    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)








Create the target distribution


.. code-block:: default

    distribution = ot.Normal(2)
    N = 300








1. Monte Carlo


.. code-block:: default

    experiment = ot.MonteCarloExperiment(distribution, N)
    sample = experiment.generate()
    graph = ot.Cloud(sample)
    view = viewer.View(graph)

2. LHS

    experiment = ot.LHSExperiment(distribution, N)
