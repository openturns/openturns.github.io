Test the design point with the Strong Maximum Test
==================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-27

In this example we are going to validate a FORM estimation using the Strong Maximum Test.

The Strong Maximum Test helps to evaluate the quality of the design point
resulting from the optimization algorithm. It checks whether the design point computed is:

- the **true** design point, which means a global maximum point,
- a **strong** design point, which means that there is no other local maximum
  located on the event boundary and which likelihood is slightly inferior to the design point one.

This verification is very important in order to give sense to the FORM and SORM approximations.

We briefly recall here the main principles of the test.
The objective is to detect all the points :math:`\tilde{P}^*` in the ball of radius
:math:`R_{\varepsilon} = \beta(1+\delta_{\varepsilon})` which are potentially the
real design point (case of :math:`\tilde{P}_2^*`) or which contribution to :math:`P_f` is
not negligeable as regards the approximations Form and Sorm (case of :math:`\tilde{P}_1^*`).
The contribution of a point is considered as negligeable when its likelihood in
the :math:`U`-space is more than :math:`\varepsilon`-times lesser than the design point one.
The radius :math:`R_{\varepsilon}` is the distance to the :math:`U`-space center upon which
points are considered as negligeable in the evaluation of :math:`P_f`.
