Create a composite design of experiments
========================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-9

In this example we create a deterministic design experiment with the `Composite` class.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 11-17

.. code-block:: Python

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as viewer
    from matplotlib import pylab as plt

    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 18-19

Define position, scale

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-22

.. code-block:: Python

    center = [0.5, 1.5]
    levels = [4, 8, 16]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-24

Create the design

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-27

.. code-block:: Python

    experiment = ot.Composite(center, levels)
    sample = experiment.generate()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-29

Plot the design

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-34

.. code-block:: Python

    graph = ot.Graph("Composite design", "x1", "x2", True, "")
    cloud = ot.Cloud(sample, "blue", "fsquare", "")
    graph.add(cloud)
    view = viewer.View(graph)
    plt.show()
