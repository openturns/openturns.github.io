Deterministic design of experiments
===================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-18

In this example we present the available deterministic design of experiments.

Four types of deterministic design of experiments are available:

- `Axial`
- `Factorial`
- `Composite`
- `Box`

Each type of deterministic design is discretized differently according to a number of levels.

Functionally speaking, a design is a `Sample` that lies within the unit cube :math:`(0,1)^d` and can be scaled and moved to cover the desired box.
