Create a design of experiments with discrete and continuous variables
=====================================================================

In this example we present how to create a design of experiments when one (or several) of the marginals are discrete.


.. code-block:: default

    from __future__ import print_function
    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as viewer
    from matplotlib import pylab as plt
    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)








To create the first marginal of the distribution, we select a univariate discrete distribution. Some of them, like the `Bernoulli` or `Geometric` distributions, are implemented in the library as classes. In this example however, we pick the `UserDefined` distribution that assigns equal weights to the values -2, -1, 1 and 2.


.. code-block:: default

    sample = ot.Sample([[-2.], [-1.], [1.], [2.]])
    sample






.. raw:: html

    <TABLE><TR><TD></TD><TH>v0</TH></TR>
    <TR><TH>0</TH><TD>-2</TD></TR>
    <TR><TH>1</TH><TD>-1</TD></TR>
    <TR><TH>2</TH><TD>1</TD></TR>
    <TR><TH>3</TH><TD>2</TD></TR>
    </TABLE>
    <br />
    <br />


.. code-block:: default

    X0 = ot.UserDefined(sample)








For the second marginal, we pick a Gaussian distribution.


.. code-block:: default

    X1 = ot.Normal()








Create the multivariate distribution from its marginals and an independent copula.


.. code-block:: default

    distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([X0,X1])








Create the design.


.. code-block:: default

    size = 100
    experiment = ot.MonteCarloExperiment(distribution, size)
    sample = experiment.generate()








Plot the design.


.. code-block:: default

    graph = ot.Graph("MonteCarloExperiment", "x0", "x1", True, "")
    cloud = ot.Cloud(sample, "blue", "fsquare", "")
    graph.add(cloud)
    view = viewer.View(graph)

    :alt: MonteCarloExperiment
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





Any other type of design of experiments can be generated based on this distribution. The following example shows a LHS experiment.


.. code-block:: default

    size = 100
    alwaysShuffle = True
    randomShift = True
    experiment = ot.LHSExperiment(distribution, size, alwaysShuffle, randomShift)
    sample = experiment.generate()









.. code-block:: default

    graph = ot.Graph("LHSExperiment", "x0", "x1", True, "")
    cloud = ot.Cloud(sample, "blue", "fsquare", "")
    graph.add(cloud)
    view = viewer.View(graph)
    plt.show()
