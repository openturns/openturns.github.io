Tensor approximation of the cantilever beam model
=================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-9

In this example, we create a low-rank approximation in the canonical tensor format of the cantilever beam. 

In order to fit the hyper-parameters of the approximation, we use a design of experiments which size is 10000. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 11-45

We consider a cantilever beam defined by its Youngâ€™s modulus :math:`E`, its length :math:`L` and its section modulus :math:`I`. One end of the cantilever beam is built in a wall and we apply a concentrated bending load :math:`F` at the other end of the beam, resulting in a deviation :math:`Y`. 

<img src="beam.png" width="200">

**Inputs**

* :math:`E` : Young modulus (Pa), Beta(r = 0.9, t = 3.5, a = :math:`2.5\times 10^7`, :math:`b = 5\times 10^7`)
* :math:`F` : Loading (N), Lognormal(:math:`\mu_F=30 \times 10^3`, :math:`\sigma_F=9\times 10^3`, shift= :math:`15 \times 10^3`)
* :math:`L` : Length of beam (cm), Uniform(min=250.0, max= 260.0)
* :math:`I` : Moment of inertia (cm^4), Beta(r = 2.5, t = 4.0, a = 310, b = 450).

In the previous table :math:`\mu_F=E(F)` and :math:`\sigma_F=\sqrt{V(F)}` are the mean and the standard deviation of :math:`F`.

We assume that the random variables E, F, L and I are dependent and associated with a gaussian copula which correlation matrix is :

.. math::
   R = \begin{pmatrix}
         1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
         0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
         0 & 0 & 1 & -0.2 \\
         0 & 0 & -0.2 & 1
       \end{pmatrix}


In other words, we consider that the variables L and I are negatively correlated : when the length L increases, the moment of intertia I decreases.

**Output**

The vertical displacement at free end of the cantilever beam is:

.. math::
   Y  = \dfrac{F\, L^3}{3 \, E \, I}

Definition of the model
-----------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-56

.. code-block:: default

    import openturns as ot
    import openturns.viewer as viewer
    from matplotlib import pylab as plt
    ot.Log.Show(ot.Log.NONE)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-58

We define the symbolic function which evaluates the output Y depending on the inputs E, F, L and I.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-62

.. code-block:: default

    model = ot.SymbolicFunction(["E", "F", "L", "I"], ["F*L^3/(3*E*I)"])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-64

Then we define the distribution of the input random vector. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-67

Young's modulus E

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-80

.. code-block:: default

    E = ot.Beta(0.9, 3.5, 2.5e7, 5.0e7) # in N/m^2
    E.setDescription("E")
    # Load F
    F = ot.LogNormal() # in N
    F.setParameter(ot.LogNormalMuSigma()([30.e3, 9e3, 15.e3]))
    F.setDescription("F")
    # Length L

    L.setDescription("L")
    # Moment of inertia I
    I = ot.Beta(2.5, 4, 310, 450) # in cm^4
    I.setDescription("I")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-82

Finally, we define the dependency using a `NormalCopula`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 84-86

.. code-block:: default

    myDistribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([E, F, L, I])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-89

Create the design of experiments
--------------------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-92

We consider a simple Monte-Carlo sampling as a design of experiments. This is why we generate an input sample using the `getSample` method of the distribution. Then we evaluate the output using the `model` function.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 94-98

.. code-block:: default

    sampleSize_train = 10000
    X_train = myDistribution.getSample(sampleSize_train)
    Y_train = model(X_train)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-100

The following figure presents the distribution of the vertical deviations Y on the training sample. We observe that the large deviations occur less often. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 102-108

.. code-block:: default

    histo = ot.HistogramFactory().build(Y_train).drawPDF()
    histo.setXTitle("Vertical deviation (cm)")
    histo.setTitle("Distribution of the vertical deviation")
    histo.setLegends([""])
    view = viewer.View(histo)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 109-111

Create the metamodel
--------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 113-126

We recall that the metamodel write as :

.. math:: f(X_1, \dots, X_d) = \sum_{i=1}^m \prod_{j=1}^d v_j^{(i)} (x_j), \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d :math:``

with :
    v_j^{(i)} (x_j) = \sum_{k=1}^{n_j} \beta_{j,k}^{(i)} \phi_{j,k} (x_j) :math:``

We should define :

 - The family of univariate functions :math:`\phi_j`. We choose the orthogonal basis with respect to the marginal distribution measures.
 - The maximal rank :math:`m`. Here value is set to 5
 - The marginal degrees :math:`n_j`. Here we set the degrees to [4, 15, 3, 2]


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 128-133

.. code-block:: default

    factoryCollection = [ot.OrthogonalUniVariatePolynomialFunctionFactory(ot.StandardDistributionPolynomialFactory(_)) for _ in [E,F,L,I]]
    functionFactory = ot.OrthogonalProductFunctionFactory(factoryCollection)
    nk = [4, 15, 3, 2]
    maxRank = 1








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 134-135

Finally we might launch the algorithm:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 137-142

.. code-block:: default

    algo = ot.TensorApproximationAlgorithm(X_train, Y_train, myDistribution, functionFactory, nk, maxRank)
    algo.run()
    result = algo.getResult()
    metamodel = result.getMetaModel()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 143-152

The `run` method has optimized the hyperparameters of the metamodel (:math:`\beta` coefficients). 

We can then print the coefficients which have been estimated using a double loop.

>>> for j in range(myDistribution.getDimension()):
>>>    print("j =", j)
>>>    for i in range(nk[j]):
>>>        print(tensor.getCoefficients(i,j))


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 154-156

.. code-block:: default

    tensor = result.getTensor()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 157-159

Validate the metamodel
----------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 161-162

We finally want to validate the kriging metamodel. This is why we generate a validation sample which size is equal to 100 and we evaluate the output of the model on this sample.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 164-168

.. code-block:: default

    sampleSize_test = 200
    X_test = myDistribution.getSample(sampleSize_test)
    Y_test = model(X_test)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 169-170

The `MetaModelValidation` classe makes the validation easy. To create it, we use the validation samples and the metamodel. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 172-174

.. code-block:: default

    val = ot.MetaModelValidation(X_test, Y_test, metamodel)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 175-176

The `computePredictivityFactor` computes the Q2 factor. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 178-181

.. code-block:: default

    Q2 = val.computePredictivityFactor()[0]
    Q2





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    0.9997203737353572



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 182-183

Since the Q2 is larger than 95%, we can say that the quality is acceptable. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 185-186

The residuals are the difference between the model and the metamodel. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 188-192

.. code-block:: default

    r = val.getResidualSample()
    graph = ot.HistogramFactory().build(r).drawPDF()
    view = viewer.View(graph)

    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 193-194

We observe that the negative residuals occur with nearly the same frequency of the positive residuals: this is a first   sign of good quality. Furthermore, the residuals are most of the times contained in the [-1,1] interval, which is a sign of quality given the amplitude of the output (approximately from 5 to 25 cm).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 196-197

The `drawValidation` method allows to compare the observed outputs and the metamodel outputs.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 199-204

.. code-block:: default

    graph = val.drawValidation()
    graph.setTitle("Q2 = %.2f%%" % (100*Q2))
    view = viewer.View(graph)

    plt.show()



.. image:: /auto_meta_modeling/low_rank_tensors_metamodel/images/sphx_glr_plot_tensor_cantilever_beam_003.png
    :alt: Q2 = 99.97%
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 205-208

We observe that the metamodel predictions are close to the model outputs, since most red points are close to the diagonal. However, when we consider extreme deviations (i.e. less than 10 or larger than 20), then the quality is less obvious.

Given that the kriging metamodel quality is sensitive to the design of experiments, it might be interesting to consider a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) design to further improve the predictions quality.
