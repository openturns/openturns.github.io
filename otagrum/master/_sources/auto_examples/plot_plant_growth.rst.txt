Plant growth
============

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 7-44

The study presented in that section focuses on the growth of particular plant
(not specified).
The objective is to predict which height will be reached by the plant ...
for example in order to evaluate the risk that the plant might require a
greater jag on the balcony ...

The problem is that we have no data on the height usually reached by this
kind of plant, which prohibits any use of statistics tools ...
So ... what ? Yet we have the following information:

   - we know the influence of the quality of the light and the influence of
     the air moisture rate on the plant growth,
   - we can quantify the quality of the light we have at home and also the
     air moisture rate where the plant lives.

.... so we can model the plant growth thanks to a Bayes net and then have
access to the variability of its final height!

Let us imagine (for the example purpose):

 - Some meteorological data (tropical place?):

   - the balcony is in plain light 3 times out of 4,
   - in the darkness, the air is moist 8 times out of 10,
   - in plain light, the air is dry 6 times out of 10.

 - Some remembrance of biology trainings:

   - in plain light, if the air is moist, the plant is very happy: it grows
     90cm on average with a variation of :math:`\pm` 10 cm. If the air is too dry,
     it will not grow more than 30 cm but we reasonably can expect about a
     15 cm growth.
   - in the darkness, if the air is too dry, the plant suffers: it will not
     grow more than 20 cm and might die as well! If the air is moist, it
     will  usually grow about 30 cm, at least 15cm but not more than 50 cm.

Both variables **Light** and **Moisture** are categorical variables with
the following attributes:

 - **Light** has 2 attributes: **Dim** which refers to the darkness and
   **Bright** which refers to plain light situations,
 - **Moisture** has 2 attributes: **Dry** which refers to dry air situations
   and **Wet** which refers to wet air situations.

**Height** is a continuous variable which has to be discretized for the Bayes Net use.

The next step is the quantification of the Bayes net.

The variable **Light** is quantified as follows:

 - **Light=Dim** with a probability of 0.25,

We can study the plant growth variability in different situations like:

 - I put my plant on my balcony; in that situation, I set none evidence
   inside the Bayes net.
 - I put my plant in a  place where it is dark all time (in my cellar?);
   in that situation, I set one evidence inside the Bayes net: **Light=Dim**.
 - I put my plant in a  place where it is moist all time (in my bathroom?);
   in that situation, I set one evidence inside the Bayes net: **Moisture=Wet**.
