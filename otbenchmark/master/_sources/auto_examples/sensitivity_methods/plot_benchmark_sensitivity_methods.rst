When we estimate Sobol' indices, we may encounter the following warning messages:
```
WRN - The estimated first order Sobol index (2) is greater than its total order index ...
WRN - The estimated total order Sobol index (2) is lesser than first order index ...
```
Lots of these messages are printed in the current Notebook. This is why we disable them with:

Define the metric
-----------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 154-165

We consider the following accuracy metrics:

* the vector or log relative errors for a given index (first order or total order),
* the mean log relative error, as the mean of the LRE vector (first order or total order),
* the average mean log relative error, as the mean of the first and total order mean log relative error.

Larger LRE values are prefered.

The first order (resp. total order) mean LRE represents the mean number of digits for all components
of the first order indices (resp. total order indices).
The average mean LRE represents the mean LRE for both first and total order indices.
