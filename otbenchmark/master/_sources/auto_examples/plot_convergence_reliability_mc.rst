Convergence of Monte-Carlo to estimate the probability in a reliability problem
===============================================================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 7-12

The goal of this document is to present the convergence of the Monte-Carlo algorithm
to the exact probability when the sample size increases.
This convergence is expressed in terms of absolute error.
We show that the rate of convergence is :math:`O(\sqrt{n})`,
where :math:`n` is the sample size.
