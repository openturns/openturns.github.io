        "In the following loop, we compare the distribution of the sensitivity indices computed and the actual distribution\nof the estimator computed by Monte-Carlo sampling (using kernel smoothing).\nThe distribution of the sensitivity indices can be computed either from bootstrap\n(using kernel smoothing to approximate the distribution)\nor from asymptotic analysis (using a Gaussian distribution).\n\nIn both cases, the distribution is estimated using one sample only.\nOn the contrary, the actual distribution of the estimator (i.e. the reference distribution) is computed\nby generating independent realizations of the estimator.\nHence, it is expected that the distribution computed is not centered on the true value of the sensitivity indices.\nInstead, the distribution based on the sample of estimators must be centered on the true value of the index,\nsince these estimators are consistent, converge to the true value when the sample size increase\nand have no observable bias (although this is not proven by theory).\n\nThe two essential parameters in the script are the following:\n\n- `sampleSize` is the size of the sample used to estimated on set of sensitivity\n  indices (the number of sensitivity indices is equal to twice, because of first and total order Sobol' indices,\n  the product of the number of input variables),\n- `numberOfRepetitions` is the size of the Monte-Carlo sample of sensitivity indices.\n\nWe do not necessarily want to use a large value of `sampleSize`.\nThis may be required, however, if we want to check the asymptotic distribution computed,\nbecause the asymptotic regime may not be reached for small values and the code cannot be blamed for that.\nThis is why the asymptotic option may fail if `sampleSize` is not large enough.\nThe bootstrap option may fail too, because the sample size may be so small that re-sampling\nin the basic sample may not provide enough variability.\n\nThe value of `numberOfRepetitions` must be as large as possible because it ensures that\nthe reference distribution used for this verification is accurate enough.\n\n"
